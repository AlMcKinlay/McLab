the non-existent Pokemon life let&#39;s talk (0:46 - 0:52)
about some monster hunter Alpha Clash (0:50 - 0:54)
Flesh and Blood all the things that I (0:52 - 0:58)
play is the Monster Hunter Go game out (0:54 - 1:03)
oh yeah oh you playing it no oh no I I (0:58 - 1:05)
did play it I did play it for a little (1:03 - 1:09)
while um but uh yeah even on there was (1:05 - 1:12)
like a Pokemon go Community Day where (1:09 - 1:14)
you and I walked the Art Park and I did (1:12 - 1:17)
Monster Hunter for that you did Monster (1:14 - 1:20)
Hunter uh are they just big monsters to (1:17 - 1:21)
hunt is that thing you like walk around (1:20 - 1:23)
and find them and hunt them yes but you (1:21 - 1:25)
have to actually battle them and walking (1:23 - 1:27)
and battling and dodging and it&#39;s kind (1:25 - 1:29)
of like when you would go against the (1:27 - 1:31)
gyms and actually pretend like you were (1:29 - 1:33)
dodging except you actually do have to (1:31 - 1:35)
dodge and you have to hit the monsters (1:33 - 1:36)
in certain (1:35 - 1:39)
spots that I forget there is dodging in (1:36 - 1:41)
Pokemon go cuz I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever (1:39 - 1:44)
done it I have dodged when I&#39;ve only had (1:41 - 1:46)
four people in the thing and we&#39;re like (1:44 - 1:48)
it says seven but we&#39;re going to do it (1:46 - 1:50)
with four and every once in a while I&#39;ll (1:48 - 1:52)
Dodge and uh for the amount of time that (1:50 - 1:54)
I was playing um I think it&#39;s actually (1:52 - 1:57)
Monster Hunter now is the uh actual name (1:54 - 1:59)
of it uh they did not have the switch (1:57 - 2:02)
axe available as a weapon and if anybody (1:59 - 2:06)
knows anything I only use the switch axx (2:02 - 2:08)
so are you are you saying that monster (2:06 - 2:13)
hunter now was good but just not for you (2:08 - 2:16)
or did you not enjoy your time with (2:13 - 2:22)
it it was okay and not for (2:16 - 2:22)
me I&#39;m sure there&#39;s somebody out there (2:22 - 2:26)
that likes it because I still get emails (2:24 - 2:28)
from them and they have seasons and it&#39;s (2:26 - 2:30)
like rainy season or something and (2:28 - 2:32)
they&#39;re bringing the remember the (2:30 - 2:36)
rainbow dragon with the bubbles mhm that (2:32 - 2:37)
one (2:36 - 2:40)
it&#39;s I can&#39;t remember the names of (2:37 - 2:43)
monsters but it it it goes like this it (2:40 - 2:45)
looks like a traditional Chinese dragon (2:43 - 2:47)
with a kind of like a lion head and it (2:45 - 2:51)
has the bubbles and I&#39;ve I&#39;ve only heard (2:47 - 2:53)
good things about Monster Hunter now I (2:51 - 2:56)
ran into yeah all of your friends work (2:53 - 2:59)
for Niantic so course they&#39;re gonna say (2:56 - 3:02)
good things you don&#39;t have any other (2:59 - 3:04)
friends I don&#39;t think anyone at Niantic (3:02 - 3:08)
actually likes me I ran into um xav (3:04 - 3:12)
Woods at the airport and we were we were (3:08 - 3:14)
that&#39;s the creator of the Cabbage Patch (3:12 - 3:17)
Kids no Austin Creed Xavier Woods the (3:14 - 3:20)
new day I heard Tiger Woods and I&#39;m like (3:17 - 3:23)
how is this at allcable I ran into tiger (3:20 - 3:27)
I&#39;m like why Tiger Woods no Xavier Woods (3:23 - 3:29)
yes and he asked me if I was playing (3:27 - 3:31)
Monster Hunter now and I said no and he (3:29 - 3:34)
said it was awesome and he loves it but (3:31 - 3:37)
I I&#39;ve heard that from multiple people (3:34 - 3:39)
who have played it as a monster hunter (3:37 - 3:42)
fan I would like to play it but also I (3:39 - 3:44)
know that I can only limit myself to (3:42 - 3:48)
like two mobile games before goodbye (3:44 - 3:51)
Pikmin the pikmin&#39;s already gone no good (3:48 - 3:54)
thank goodness pikmin&#39;s gone it&#39;s (3:51 - 3:56)
Pokemon go and Pokemon sleep those are (3:54 - 4:01)
like the two that I put time into (3:56 - 4:04)
speaking of Pokemon sleep look at those (4:01 - 4:07)
the transitions are as smooth as (4:04 - 4:09)
ever super smooth you didn&#39;t you didn&#39;t (4:07 - 4:11)
miss a beat (4:09 - 4:16)
will uh it is Pokemon&#39;s sleep Oney year (4:11 - 4:19)
anniversary and for whatever reason this (4:16 - 4:22)
is not a complaint but for whatever (4:19 - 4:24)
reason they tried they they treated this (4:22 - 4:27)
as like the seven days of Christmas well (4:24 - 4:28)
I (4:27 - 4:31)
mean you sleep for a week it&#39;s the (4:28 - 4:33)
Rumple stillin (4:31 - 4:37)
rules he left for 20 years (4:33 - 4:41)
well here okay I have like two extra (4:37 - 4:44)
Pokeball plus pluses in my house I (4:41 - 4:46)
bought yes because this is actually the (4:44 - 4:49)
one-year anniversary of me dodging every (4:46 - 4:51)
attempt at you trying to get me to play (4:49 - 4:56)
Pokemon sleep I okay Greg back me up I (4:51 - 4:58)
think I think will would genuinely like (4:56 - 5:01)
Pokemon sleep it&#39;s like on what it&#39;s (4:58 - 5:04)
like swiper from uh what is the the (5:01 - 5:06)
little girl Dora the Explorer Dora it&#39;s (5:04 - 5:08)
like swiper except every he&#39;s not trying (5:06 - 5:10)
he never tries to swipe things from my (5:08 - 5:12)
backpack whenever I go to his house he (5:10 - 5:15)
tries to sneak the Pokemon plus plus I (5:12 - 5:16)
want hear your case why will would like (5:15 - 5:20)
Pokemon sleep I do enjoy sleeping apart (5:16 - 5:22)
from sleeping apart from sleeping apart (5:20 - 5:25)
from not counting the sleep that&#39;s a (5:22 - 5:27)
good (5:25 - 5:28)
[Music] (5:27 - 5:30)
point half half the game is something (5:28 - 5:34)
will already does uh because Will loves (5:30 - 5:36)
consistency and loves a routine and (5:34 - 5:40)
Pokemon sleep is a consistent routine (5:36 - 5:42)
that is true he ain&#39;t wrong there that (5:40 - 5:47)
is true a very orderly life but the (5:42 - 5:49)
question is is what are you kicking out (5:47 - 5:53)
of your five minute routine to feed some (5:49 - 5:56)
Pokemon see right and that&#39;s what killed (5:53 - 5:59)
Pok√©mon go for me because I have you (5:56 - 6:01)
know know X number of minutes in the (5:59 - 6:04)
morning to do stuff and I was like boy I (6:01 - 6:06)
am spending all this time sending gifts (6:04 - 6:08)
every single day and trying to do all (6:06 - 6:10)
the Pokemon go routines that you have to (6:08 - 6:13)
do every single day and I don&#39;t like it (6:10 - 6:16)
and I don&#39;t know why Pokemon sleep is G (6:13 - 6:20)
somehow be better I I would argue that (6:16 - 6:23)
Pokemon go doesn&#39;t really have a routine (6:20 - 6:24)
like yes there are things you can do (6:23 - 6:26)
every day like spin a stop catch a (6:24 - 6:29)
Pokemon send gifts but Pokemon sleep is (6:26 - 6:30)
like this is the thing you check in the (6:29 - 6:33)
morning you do your 10 minutes not even (6:30 - 6:34)
10 minutes probably closer to five (6:33 - 6:37)
minutes and then you check back in at (6:34 - 6:39)
lunchtime and then you check in before (6:37 - 6:42)
you go to bed three times a day well I (6:39 - 6:44)
don&#39;t check in at lunchtime they can (6:42 - 6:47)
suffer I&#39;m at work they do not need (6:44 - 6:49)
attention they can play amongst (6:47 - 6:51)
themselves there are grown adult Pokemon (6:49 - 6:55)
who need to learn how to (6:51 - 6:57)
self-regulate also they should be on (6:55 - 7:00)
what is it the fast the you only eat (6:57 - 7:02)
like 8 hours out of the day yeah (7:00 - 7:03)
intermittent fasting intermittent (7:02 - 7:05)
fasting yeah I feed them in the morning (7:03 - 7:06)
and I feed them at night and there&#39;s an (7:05 - 7:08)
8 hour break where they don&#39;t get food (7:06 - 7:09)
this isn&#39;t like weightlifting where (7:08 - 7:11)
you&#39;re just like slamming chicken and (7:09 - 7:13)
nothing else when you&#39;re talking to two (7:11 - 7:16)
swls you&#39;re going to get some intered (7:13 - 7:19)
fting some okay and first off second off (7:16 - 7:21)

announcements some are more talkable (10:35 - 10:40)
than others the day one announcement is (10:37 - 10:42)
they&#39;ve introduced the Ultra Ball or the (10:40 - 10:45)
ultra biscuit sorry the ultra biscuit (10:42 - 10:47)

biscuit so a pokey biscuit will give you (10:50 - 10:55)
one tick towards catching a Pokemon (10:52 - 10:58)
great biscuit is three ticks um if (10:55 - 11:00)

free biscuit Greg is three ticks yeah (11:00 - 11:05)
unless they&#39;re hungry I only give the (11:03 - 11:07)
ones that are hungry and then my free (11:05 - 11:11)
biscuit as a premium player is four (11:07 - 11:14)
ticks and then the ultra biscuit is five (11:11 - 11:17)
ticks which is great you pay $10 a month (11:14 - 11:21)
to get one extra tick oh (11:17 - 11:28)
yeah I sure do oh man um so we&#39;ve talked (11:21 - 11:31)
about the ultra biscuit being a possible (11:28 - 11:34)
item coming it is exactly what we wanted (11:31 - 11:36)
it to be which is like the five ticks (11:34 - 11:39)
Ultra biscuit what we didn&#39;t want it to (11:36 - 11:44)
be was insanely expensive it is 400 gems (11:39 - 11:47)
for one Ultra biscuit you&#39;re allowed to (11:44 - 11:50)
only buy three which is weird in itself (11:47 - 11:52)
if you just want our money why did you (11:50 - 11:57)
put a cap on that uh 400 gems is like $6 (11:52 - 12:01)
in this game (11:57 - 12:01)
yeah I&#39;m not buying it I got my one for (12:01 - 12:06)
free and I said well uh if something I (12:03 - 12:09)
really want happens I&#39;ll use it then (12:06 - 12:13)
otherwise no yeah very uh very expensive (12:09 - 12:15)
but it&#39;s here they gave everyone a free (12:13 - 12:18)
one which is great so that was the day (12:15 - 12:21)
one surprise they&#39;re going to add it to (12:18 - 12:24)
the point system at some point right (12:21 - 12:27)
like I would assume so this is a limited (12:24 - 12:28)
time that is this expensive and then (12:27 - 12:31)
they&#39;re going to be like all right let&#39;s (12:28 - 12:33)
let&#39;s put it in and have they done that (12:31 - 12:35)
in the past within the past (12:33 - 12:38)
year it just went in this (12:35 - 12:40)
week no but have there been other items (12:38 - 12:44)
that were introduced one way wow uh I (12:40 - 12:47)
think the travel pass was it was (12:44 - 12:49)
introduced I thought that was always in (12:47 - 12:51)
the shop for first (12:49 - 12:53)
points I think I feel like they made a (12:51 - 12:56)
big deal about that oh maybe maybe day (12:53 - 12:58)
two is the uh increasing the research (12:56 - 13:00)
Rank and the PO (12:58 - 13:04)
level cap so it&#39;s going from 55 to 60 (13:00 - 13:07)
and then certain main skills can go from (13:04 - 13:09)
level six to level seven so that&#39;s (13:07 - 13:11)
ingredient magnet s that would be your (13:09 - 13:14)

be ingredient bag ingredient pocket (13:40 - 13:48)
storage not to be confused with the item (13:44 - 13:53)
storage yeah I well s is the S is the (13:48 - 13:57)
good one and M is the I don&#39;t understand (13:53 - 13:59)
why I always read it as small and (13:57 - 14:02)
mediums always see as m is better m is (13:59 - 14:06)
worse than S yes the only m in the game (14:02 - 14:10)
right now is charge strength M there&#39;s (14:06 - 14:13)
ingredient something M I saw it there&#39;s (14:10 - 14:16)
no ingredient magnet M yet there is (14:13 - 14:20)
ingredient Finder M that&#39;s (14:16 - 14:24)

medium and S is small or is it some sort (14:24 - 14:27)
of (14:26 - 14:30)

bonus area this is a really really cool (15:37 - 15:42)
change when you reach a Max area bonus (15:39 - 15:45)
the 5% that would normally go to that uh (15:42 - 15:48)
will now be automatically divided uh and (15:45 - 15:51)
distributed across the other areas so if (15:48 - 15:52)
you have to go to green grass for an (15:51 - 15:54)
event but your green grass is already (15:52 - 15:55)
maxed out you don&#39;t have to worry about (15:54 - 15:57)
like oh I&#39;m going to lose my bonus (15:55 - 15:58)
they&#39;re going to move that bonus to (15:57 - 16:02)
other areas you haven&#39;t been yet (15:58 - 16:04)
um and unfortunately I don&#39;t keep my (16:02 - 16:06)
sleep routine I don&#39;t haven&#39;t been going (16:04 - 16:09)
to bed at my normal times I&#39;ve been (16:06 - 16:12)
sneaking out to the VFW to do karaoke so (16:09 - 16:14)
that when J Greg and I have our karaoke (16:12 - 16:18)
battle I&#39;ll have practiced cheater I see (16:14 - 16:19)
this is why I can&#39;t wait at Pokemon (16:18 - 16:22)
sleep this is why I have my spies sent (16:19 - 16:25)
me video of your singing you did not you (16:22 - 16:27)
did (16:25 - 16:30)
not oh (16:27 - 16:33)
I saw the girls just SP some spy when (16:30 - 16:35)
there&#39;s literally one person who could (16:33 - 16:38)
have done (16:35 - 16:38)
it (16:38 - 16:45)
um there will be (16:41 - 16:45)
repercussions uh there will also be okay (16:47 - 16:52)
so on day four getting through this (16:50 - 16:55)
really quickly um there is an adjustment (16:52 - 16:58)
to allow helper Pokemon with skills with (16:55 - 17:00)
skill Specialties to Bank Main skill (16:58 - 17:03)
uses currently for all helper Pokemon a (17:00 - 17:04)
main skill will not trigger until it&#39;s (17:03 - 17:06)
been used once after the adjustment the (17:04 - 17:08)
Pokemon skills specialty will be able to (17:06 - 17:12)
bank up to two of their main skills so (17:08 - 17:15)
skill Pokemon would be like Wiggly tough (17:12 - 17:18)
uh routs the any of the EES they&#39;re all (17:15 - 17:22)
skill Pokemon whereas like Pokemon like (17:18 - 17:24)
Charmander Squirtle Bulbasaur those are (17:22 - 17:26)
ingredient Pokemon and then you have (17:24 - 17:29)
like Chikorita Totodile syndic Quil are (17:26 - 17:32)
Berry Pokemon I did a whole YouTube (17:29 - 17:35)
video about this that you if you are (17:32 - 17:37)
thinking about starting Pokemon sleep or (17:35 - 17:38)
you just started playing and you feel (17:37 - 17:40)
like you&#39;re playing it wrong I just put (17:38 - 17:42)
out a whole 20 minute YouTube video (17:40 - 17:44)
explaining all of the stuff you couldn&#39;t (17:42 - 17:47)
get it into five (17:44 - 17:47)
minutes trust me my YouTube Sweet Spot (17:47 - 17:53)
is between five and 10 minutes yep if (17:50 - 17:55)
it&#39;s if it&#39;s shorter than 5 minutes I&#39;m (17:53 - 17:56)
like why are you wasting my time with (17:55 - 17:58)
this if it&#39;s longer than 10 minutes I (17:56 - 18:00)
can&#39;t get that you don&#39;t want like a (17:58 - 18:02)
three three minute YouTube (18:00 - 18:05)
documentary hour one company that can (18:02 - 18:07)
give me 3 minutes on YouTube and I will (18:05 - 18:09)
watch and their initials are (18:07 - 18:12)
WCCO yeah WCCO is good at keeping it (18:09 - 18:15)
tight yeah I don&#39;t every&#39;s like you (18:12 - 18:19)
should watch this 4our rant Fest and I&#39;m (18:15 - 18:22)
like no I don&#39;t look it&#39;s hard to get (18:19 - 18:25)
through a 4our musical and that&#39;s got an (18:22 - 18:27)
intermission in a bunch of songs to hear (18:25 - 18:30)
some person complain about somebody some (18:27 - 18:32)
person a I don&#39;t know complain about B (18:30 - 18:34)
another person I don&#39;t know for four (18:32 - 18:38)
hours what why would I do (18:34 - 18:38)
this there&#39;s some YouTube 4our things (18:38 - 18:44)
that are pretty good no but here&#39;s the (18:42 - 18:48)
thing you are not actually watching with (18:44 - 18:52)
your full attention no for that four (18:48 - 18:55)
hours will and I are old school where we (18:52 - 18:56)
had to pay attention to the (18:55 - 18:58)
entertainment that we provided so hours (18:56 - 19:01)
means we are watching we are watching (18:58 - 19:03)
that for four hours we can do nothing (19:01 - 19:05)
else because I have a lot of my four (19:03 - 19:07)
hours to this person complaining about (19:05 - 19:09)
Star Wars and that&#39;s and that&#39;s the real (19:07 - 19:10)
problem isn&#39;t it because I&#39;ve (19:09 - 19:13)
rediscovered my love of reading and if (19:10 - 19:15)
there&#39;s four hours to be had I&#39;m going (19:13 - 19:18)
to be book warming it up do you just (19:15 - 19:20)
want me to send you the the transcript (19:18 - 19:23)
of the 20 minute video send the (19:20 - 19:25)
transcript I&#39;m rejecting our AI (19:23 - 19:28)
overlords in their attempts trans I (19:25 - 19:29)
wrote this (19:28 - 19:33)
script just text it in blocks every (19:29 - 19:36)
morning for every morning wake up send a (19:33 - 19:40)
block and text to Will perfect I will (19:36 - 19:43)
um okay so uh Pokemon that don&#39;t have (19:40 - 19:45)
the skill specialty can still only bank (19:43 - 19:48)
one of their main skills uh you&#39;ll see (19:45 - 19:50)
that your helper Pokemon specialty in (19:48 - 19:53)
the upper right hand (19:50 - 19:56)
corner they didn&#39;t say when this will go (19:53 - 19:58)
into it feels like everything&#39;s in (19:56 - 20:00)
August early AUST feel like they&#39;re (19:58 - 20:02)
doing everything in August so this (20:00 - 20:05)
should (20:02 - 20:07)
make those Pokemon better I mean like (20:05 - 20:09)
the the if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a hardcore (20:07 - 20:10)
player we&#39;ve talked about this before (20:09 - 20:12)
how like gold duck is like secretly like (20:10 - 20:14)
the best Pokemon in the game right now (20:12 - 20:16)
because it is a skill Pokemon so you (20:14 - 20:19)
want Golduck with like skill trigger (20:16 - 20:22)
small skill trigger medium like helping (20:19 - 20:25)
speed and ideally it can power up (20:22 - 20:28)
Snorlax on any Island because of how but (20:25 - 20:30)
you also need like (20:28 - 20:33)
five main skill seeds because you have (20:30 - 20:35)
to get that it&#39;s only worth it if you (20:33 - 20:37)
can get the gold duck up to main skill (20:35 - 20:38)
level (20:37 - 20:42)
seven so this should make gold duck (20:38 - 20:46)
better but also it you might not see (20:42 - 20:48)
that much of a difference because (20:46 - 20:51)
depending on how often you check the app (20:48 - 20:53)
is how often that stuff (20:51 - 20:55)
triggers because in order to start the (20:53 - 20:58)
next trigger you have to activate the (20:55 - 21:00)
current to trigger so actually maybe it (20:58 - 21:01)
will be better maybe it will be (21:00 - 21:03)
significantly better but there I don&#39;t (21:01 - 21:07)
think this fixes like Meowth or or or (21:03 - 21:10)
Gulpin or any of the or like ekin I (21:07 - 21:14)
think those Pokemon are just still bad (21:10 - 21:16)
um or sorry Lucario I think you&#39;re also (21:14 - 21:18)
still bad like yes you can Bank another (21:16 - 21:22)
dream Shard magnet (21:18 - 21:25)
but it makes some Pokemon better for (21:22 - 21:28)
sure 100% but I don&#39;t think it (21:25 - 21:31)
fixes a lot of Pokemon I think some (21:28 - 21:33)
Pokemon are still going to be bad after (21:31 - 21:36)
this I mean you&#39;re attacking Lucario (21:33 - 21:38)
that&#39;s what happens miss one week and (21:36 - 21:41)
your favorite Pokemon gets attacked I (21:38 - 21:44)
think I think this is an underrated (21:41 - 21:46)
update (21:44 - 21:49)
um and it m it made me instantly think (21:46 - 21:52)
of Pokemon go Community Days uh so on (21:49 - 21:53)
day five they announced in late (21:52 - 21:56)
September not August uh we plan to hold (21:53 - 21:58)
an event that will make it easier to (21:56 - 22:00)
encounter Pokemon that you have not (21:58 - 22:03)
discovered yet Pokemon sleep Styles uh (22:00 - 22:06)
we also plan to add this bonus to good (22:03 - 22:09)
sleep day in beginning of October to (22:06 - 22:11)
make it easier to encounter Pokemon (22:09 - 22:13)
sleep Styles you haven&#39;t discovered yet (22:11 - 22:15)
so really one of the takeaways from this (22:13 - 22:17)
entire update or this entire like news (22:15 - 22:20)
cycle is it feels like they are just (22:17 - 22:22)
making it easier for people to get into (22:20 - 22:25)
this game cuz one of the turnoff I think (22:22 - 22:27)
for new players is like well I&#39;ve been (22:25 - 22:29)
playing for two weeks and I keep keep (22:27 - 22:31)
getting Caterpie or I keep getting (22:29 - 22:34)
Meowth and I want to see something new (22:31 - 22:36)
because I think Greg and I would be an (22:34 - 22:39)
agreement to be like seeing different (22:36 - 22:40)
Pokemon when you wake up is (22:39 - 22:43)
significantly more exciting than seeing (22:40 - 22:45)
Caterpie over and over seeing the same (22:43 - 22:46)
thing over and over and over again where (22:45 - 22:47)
I hit the just take all their pictures (22:46 - 22:51)
and hope something new happens today I I (22:47 - 22:53)
got I got the triplet today I put up my (22:51 - 22:55)
quackle incense thinking I&#39;ll finally (22:53 - 22:56)
get a quackle and of course that was the (22:55 - 22:59)
day two decided to show up and then it (22:56 - 23:01)
was like they&#39;re all in the same pose (22:59 - 23:03)
but I took the one picture I like (23:01 - 23:06)
there&#39;s still two new and it&#39;s G to be (23:03 - 23:07)
the same picture they&#39;re in the same (23:06 - 23:11)
pose just count them (23:07 - 23:13)
all (23:11 - 23:16)
uh yeah so why I think this reminds me (23:13 - 23:18)
of community day is because this game&#39;s (23:16 - 23:19)
only been out for a year I would say (23:18 - 23:22)
good sleep day is as close to community (23:19 - 23:24)
day as you know if you&#39;re comparing them (23:22 - 23:26)
obviously apples and oranges but still (23:24 - 23:29)
similar in in a sense of like everyone (23:26 - 23:33)
everyone should be doing that but like (23:29 - 23:35)
what was like the last major update to (23:33 - 23:37)
Community Day in Pokemon go in eight (23:35 - 23:40)
years like the four star raids I guess (23:37 - 23:44)
but that&#39;s like one (23:40 - 23:44)
thing like we&#39;re going we&#39;re recording (23:44 - 23:49)
this on Saturday because commun day is (23:47 - 23:52)
tomorrow and it&#39;s Tynamo it&#39;s a new (23:49 - 23:54)
Pokemon I don&#39;t have it shiny so I am (23:52 - 23:56)
excited to get it but at the same time (23:54 - 23:59)
it&#39;s like it&#39;s been the same thing for (23:56 - 24:03)
eight years I just wish Niantic would (23:59 - 24:06)
like Turn Up The Raid slider so there&#39;s (24:03 - 24:08)
more raids or give people like an (24:06 - 24:11)
increased chance of Lucky trade or give (24:08 - 24:14)
us more special trades because once you (24:11 - 24:16)
do one special trade like hey let&#39;s (24:14 - 24:20)
trade uh necros I have 115 necrozma Greg (24:16 - 24:22)
would you like to trade one to maybe for (24:20 - 24:24)
it to be lucky okay cool we can only do (24:22 - 24:27)
that once today and that that that&#39;s it (24:24 - 24:30)
maybe tomorrow (24:27 - 24:32)
like I I don&#39;t know what Community Day (24:30 - 24:35)
needs but I feel like I&#39;m not alone in (24:32 - 24:37)
thinking that it&#39;s been a little stale (24:35 - 24:40)
for a little too (24:37 - 24:42)
long but Tynamo is one of my favorite (24:40 - 24:46)
Pokemon are you coming out for tomorrow (24:42 - 24:48)
wander around catch some Tynamo it (24:46 - 24:52)
depends there&#39;s some life things going (24:48 - 24:53)
on (24:52 - 24:56)
sure Tynamo is (24:53 - 25:02)
life uh no Tynamo is a tiny little (24:56 - 25:02)
eel anyways my takeaway is it&#39;s it&#39;s (25:03 - 25:07)
cool that they&#39;re like slightly (25:06 - 25:09)
revamping good sleep day to be more (25:07 - 25:11)
exciting (25:09 - 25:15)
um and like more of a I don&#39;t want to (25:11 - 25:18)
miss this kind of thing uh and then on (25:15 - 25:20)
the sixth day of the Pokemon sleep&#39;s (25:18 - 25:21)
first (25:20 - 25:24)
anniversary which was July (25:21 - 25:27)
20th um which is one year since the (25:24 - 25:30)
global release (25:27 - 25:32)
they gave everyone 2,000 sleep points (25:30 - 25:35)
one main skill seed which is arguably (25:32 - 25:37)
the best item in the game uh 10 poke (25:35 - 25:40)
biscuits and three friend (25:37 - 25:43)
incense uh and not to compare it to (25:40 - 25:48)
Pokemon go but amazing items they (25:43 - 25:50)
continue to give super good items (25:48 - 25:52)
throughout the year this is great I (25:50 - 25:55)
can&#39;t think of like the best time like I (25:52 - 25:57)
can&#39;t think of a single time where (25:55 - 26:00)
Niantic was incred L (25:57 - 26:04)
generous at all in eight (26:00 - 26:06)
years I got like the closest I could (26:04 - 26:09)
think of is like early Christmas events (26:06 - 26:10)
where you would go out and spin a stop (26:09 - 26:12)
and get an incubator and they did that (26:10 - 26:13)
for like what like seven days or (26:12 - 26:16)
something yeah but you still had to (26:13 - 26:20)
actively work for it this you have until (26:16 - 26:22)
the end of September all you have to do (26:20 - 26:24)
is log in and hit accept and you get all (26:22 - 26:25)
these (26:24 - 26:29)
rewards like it is just crazy the (26:25 - 26:32)
difference between these developers and (26:29 - 26:35)
Niantic Pokemon go wants you to leave (26:32 - 26:37)
your bed Pokemon sleeps like never leave (26:35 - 26:42)
your bed never go lie there hit the (26:37 - 26:44)
button hit the button and we&#39;ll give you (26:42 - 26:48)
free gifts they are the anti- movement (26:44 - 26:50)
these are the two competing Pokemon (26:48 - 26:53)
forces do you think there&#39;s a (26:50 - 26:55)
correlation (26:53 - 26:58)
between expensive like the gems and (26:55 - 27:00)
Pokemon month sleep are expensive do you (26:58 - 27:01)
think that the (27:00 - 27:05)
generosity translates into people more (27:01 - 27:09)
willing to pay those prices because they (27:05 - 27:12)
do feel like yes the generosity is there (27:09 - 27:15)
yeah I mean when I spend money in mobile (27:12 - 27:16)
games is when I feel like they&#39;ve (27:15 - 27:21)
treated me really well so when like unit (27:16 - 27:23)
does a bunch of great things I&#39;m like oh (27:21 - 27:25)
you know what you&#39;ve done a lot of (27:23 - 27:28)
really great things I I feel very valued (27:25 - 27:29)
as a customer customer I&#39;m going to give (27:28 - 27:31)
you some money I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to (27:29 - 27:34)
buy this pack or whatever Masters does (27:31 - 27:35)
that quite a bit every once a while I&#39;m (27:34 - 27:37)
like your prices are outrageous but (27:35 - 27:39)
every so often like we have a super (27:37 - 27:40)
discount and I&#39;m like you know what you (27:39 - 27:42)
do a lot of other good things so I will (27:40 - 27:46)
buy the super discount because you&#39;ve (27:42 - 27:48)
generated Goodwill I want to give you (27:46 - 27:50)
money that feels (27:48 - 27:53)
reasonable and I think sleep does that (27:50 - 27:55)
in like they do a lot of generosity (27:53 - 27:57)
really well where I don&#39;t think Pokemon (27:55 - 28:00)
go does do generosity very well I think (27:57 - 28:02)
I think a lot of people we I heard this (28:00 - 28:07)
a lot at go Fest was like another dollar (28:02 - 28:09)
another dollar for this they just need (28:07 - 28:11)
to get their dollars another dollar for (28:09 - 28:12)
this like there was a lot of people who (28:11 - 28:14)
were just (28:12 - 28:17)
like resigned to because they spent so (28:14 - 28:20)
much money to get to New York that I (28:17 - 28:22)
guess I&#39;m just going to spend more and (28:20 - 28:25)
it&#39;s like sunk cost fallacy in Pokemon (28:22 - 28:27)
go none of that sounded like you were (28:25 - 28:29)
excited to spend this it sounded like (28:27 - 28:32)
well I might as well like I I guess I&#39;m (28:29 - 28:36)
here and I need to do something (28:32 - 28:36)
today (28:38 - 28:44)
yeah not even like there are good values (28:40 - 28:47)
in Pokemon go like I think if you did (28:44 - 28:51)
buy the $15 go Fest ticket you got your (28:47 - 28:54)
Soo you got your your you got your (28:51 - 28:57)
marshadow you got your necrozma for free (28:54 - 28:59)
you got more than enough like the raid (28:57 - 29:01)
passes alone gives you your stuff you (28:59 - 29:03)
get your increased shiny chance like I&#39;m (29:01 - 29:05)
not saying there&#39;s not good values in (29:03 - 29:07)
Pok√©mon go there (29:05 - 29:11)
are um and go Fest was fine it was good (29:07 - 29:14)
like I enjoyed it I&#39;m just there&#39;s just (29:11 - 29:16)
moments of like gener like what was (29:14 - 29:18)
niantic&#39;s eight-year anniversary it was (29:16 - 29:21)
you could give us $5 for this (29:18 - 29:23)
anniversary (29:21 - 29:26)
bundle well just wait for the 10y year (29:23 - 29:29)
anniversary GNA break all the stuff I I (29:26 - 29:32)
again (29:29 - 29:35)
maybe I mean I am bitter there&#39;s I was (29:32 - 29:36)
going to say maybe I&#39;m not bitter I am (29:35 - 29:40)
bitter but I I do think that that it&#39;s (29:36 - 29:41)
not too late for (29:40 - 29:46)
Niantic to go down a path like Pokemon (29:41 - 29:48)
Masters or like Pokemon sleep and (29:46 - 29:51)
actually be generous and actually reward (29:48 - 29:56)
players to like reestablish that (29:51 - 30:00)
Goodwill um (29:56 - 30:01)
I was going to say the last time they (30:00 - 30:02)
gave us like something free was like (30:01 - 30:05)
that free seasonal pass not this season (30:02 - 30:08)
but the one before but it it didn&#39;t it (30:05 - 30:13)
was like get an encounter with a a Lian (30:08 - 30:16)
like H I guess sure getting an encounter (30:13 - 30:17)
with a nan (30:16 - 30:20)
Diglett like it wasn&#39;t that great and (30:17 - 30:23)
there are things in Pokemon go that do (30:20 - 30:26)
feel valuable that people would (30:23 - 30:29)
appreciate like (30:26 - 30:32)
remote raid passes or like super (30:29 - 30:35)
incubators like it cost Niantic nothing (30:32 - 30:37)
to be like happy anniversary here are (30:35 - 30:40)
three super incubators have a great week (30:37 - 30:43)
yeah or like we&#39;re doing an egg hatch a (30:40 - 30:47)
thing here&#39;s two here&#39;s I don&#39;t even (30:43 - 30:48)
like understand the logic against it (30:47 - 30:50)
because if you&#39;re doing an event that (30:48 - 30:52)
requires you to get out of the house and (30:50 - 30:54)
like hatch eggs I feel like giving your (30:52 - 30:57)
customers three free incubators prior to (30:54 - 31:00)
that event would probably maybe I&#39;m (30:57 - 31:02)
wrong probably lead them to buy more (31:00 - 31:04)
incubators because they&#39;d be like oh man (31:02 - 31:08)
this well I use my three I&#39;m (31:04 - 31:11)
done but like I&#39;m already out I&#39;m having (31:08 - 31:14)
a good time yeah maybe I&#39;ll throw them a (31:11 - 31:18)
dollar yeah (31:14 - 31:18)
I they they yeah there&#39;s a lot that I I (31:19 - 31:27)
think they could be more generous about (31:23 - 31:29)
and um we are recording this before the (31:27 - 31:32)
day seven announcement so we probably (31:29 - 31:34)
get that in like 4 hours so when this (31:32 - 31:35)
podcast goes up we&#39;ll know what day (31:34 - 31:40)
seven is I&#39;m gonna guess it&#39;s an island (31:35 - 31:42)
yeah there&#39;s going to be new island I I (31:40 - 31:46)
I feel like a new area is the the the (31:42 - 31:48)
final thing here it&#39;s probably the most (31:46 - 31:51)
exciting thing they could do is a new (31:48 - 31:53)
island and also going back to like the (31:51 - 31:56)
six days prior to this they it&#39;s sounds (31:53 - 31:59)
like again they want new players to feel (31:56 - 32:01)
like they&#39;re leveling up faster they (31:59 - 32:02)
want new players to feel like they&#39;re (32:01 - 32:04)
getting more sleep Styles more sleep (32:02 - 32:06)
Styles unlocks those new (32:04 - 32:10)
islands um so it feels like even if you (32:06 - 32:12)
just look at what they&#39;ve announced it (32:10 - 32:14)
kind of feels like they&#39;re leading up to (32:12 - 32:16)
a new island (32:14 - 32:19)
um which like if you remember when they (32:16 - 32:21)
announced lapis Lakeside people were (32:19 - 32:23)
like over the moon excited to Bringing (32:21 - 32:26)
fairy types in New Island with new (32:23 - 32:30)
islands bring new Pokemon have we (32:26 - 32:34)
have regular Island water Island cave (32:30 - 32:38)
Island Snow Island and fairy Island (32:34 - 32:40)
right yes so are we getting like Dragon (32:38 - 32:42)
Island are we going to get an official (32:40 - 32:45)
Fire Island there was Fire Island P (32:42 - 32:49)
steel Island steel Island sword Island I (32:45 - 32:50)
think there were speculation that there (32:49 - 32:53)
was like a swamp Island that was being (32:50 - 32:56)
worked on and a volcano (32:53 - 32:59)
island graveyard Island (32:56 - 33:02)
that would be I could go for volcano (32:59 - 33:04)
island except don&#39;t a lot of fire types (33:02 - 33:08)
show up in the cave Island yeah so maybe (33:04 - 33:09)
not (33:08 - 33:11)
maybe maybe swamp Island what would be (33:09 - 33:13)
in a like swamp would probably be like (33:11 - 33:18)
bug electric and poison ghost poison oh (33:13 - 33:20)
poison yeah we on poison (33:18 - 33:22)
yeah (33:20 - 33:25)
um I think there&#39;s only six types left (33:22 - 33:27)
that don&#39;t have Islands it&#39;s like would (33:25 - 33:28)
electric be in a (33:27 - 33:31)
swamp like like like bugs there&#39;s a lot (33:28 - 33:33)
of bugs that are electric fireflies like (33:31 - 33:36)
charge like charge a bug charg such a (33:33 - 33:38)
stretch (33:36 - 33:40)
no what what are all the ones that are (33:38 - 33:44)
in the Great Marsh in Diamond and (33:40 - 33:44)
Pearl yeah I guess you I guess well we (33:48 - 33:54)
already have ground right ground is (33:52 - 33:58)
already um the cave I think there&#39;s only (33:54 - 34:00)
six types left which means there would (33:58 - 34:01)
only be two islands left but I can&#39;t (34:00 - 34:04)
imagine that they would just stop at oh (34:01 - 34:06)
two like they could do another Island (34:04 - 34:09)
but just a different combination of (34:06 - 34:11)
Pokemon like oh we&#39;re repeating fairy (34:09 - 34:14)
but now it&#39;s fairy and steel and dragon (34:11 - 34:16)
instead of fairy (34:14 - 34:22)
fighting psychic um I maybe I again (34:16 - 34:24)
I I think this game is doing really well (34:22 - 34:28)
after a year so I I (34:24 - 34:30)
so I I think they I think they have a (34:28 - 34:34)
little bit of legs uh to keep going all (34:30 - 34:35)
right speaking of keeping going let&#39;s (34:34 - 34:38)
take a break uh and then when we come (34:35 - 34:42)
back uh we have Croc news not as in (34:38 - 34:44)

this update yeah garbage got all TC tpci (35:48 - 35:55)
garbage King I want to we did this last (35:51 - 35:58)
time they posted a producer letter they (35:55 - 36:02)
have a website that they were updating (35:58 - 36:07)
with news yep and they just gave up on (36:02 - 36:10)
that and they are just community. (36:07 - 36:15)
pokemon.com here you go they have a (36:10 - 36:20)
website they could just contrl c contrl (36:15 - 36:22)
v they could put it on (36:20 - 36:26)
both um that&#39;s I don&#39;t know if you know (36:22 - 36:28)
that the entire world crashed all the (36:26 - 36:31)
computers crashed uh over the weekend (36:28 - 36:33)
and haven&#39;t come back so nobody can go (36:31 - 36:34)
get money (36:33 - 36:38)
so that was real Annoying (36:34 - 36:38)
yesterday happy third anniversary (36:39 - 36:45)
trainers uh we have 15 million downloads (36:41 - 36:48)
of Pokemon unite worldwide celebrating (36:45 - 36:50)
the 3D anniversary we are also (36:48 - 36:52)
introducing a new Defender Pokemon ho oh (36:50 - 36:55)
and we have some upcoming changes uh ho (36:52 - 36:59)
oh as of yesterday well as of July 19th (36:55 - 37:04)
has appeared in the game yep (36:59 - 37:07)
the is it is ho actually categorized as (37:04 - 37:09)
the rainbow Pokemon yeah um I thought it (37:07 - 37:12)
was the Phoenix Pokemon for some reason (37:09 - 37:14)
it&#39;s the rainbow Pokemon um we don&#39;t (37:12 - 37:15)
need to go through hoo we&#39;ve already (37:14 - 37:17)
talked about what hoo does uh here&#39;s the (37:15 - 37:20)
good stuff ex license changing when ex (37:17 - 37:24)
license were introduced in December of (37:20 - 37:27)
2023 which is weird to think about (37:24 - 37:28)
because (37:27 - 37:32)
other Pokemon were introduced before (37:28 - 37:35)
that but then were changed to (37:32 - 37:35)
ex when ex came out um the intention was (37:36 - 37:43)
to express the strength of legendary (37:40 - 37:45)
Pokemon in a way that is easy for anyone (37:43 - 37:48)
to experience the this categorization (37:45 - 37:50)
was also introduced to not only help (37:48 - 37:52)
balance battles but to add (37:50 - 37:55)
dimensionality by to them by introducing (37:52 - 37:59)
weakness in exchange for strength (37:55 - 38:01)
after reviewing feedback from players (37:59 - 38:03)
via surveys we found that the system was (38:01 - 38:06)
well received by new players and those (38:03 - 38:08)
unfamiliar with Pokemon however we also (38:06 - 38:09)
found that players wanted a more (38:08 - 38:11)
balanced experience for the power levels (38:09 - 38:15)
of ex uh to be on par with other unite (38:11 - 38:18)
license what&#39;s more is some ranked (38:15 - 38:20)
seasons have restricted reducing the (38:18 - 38:21)
number of Pokemon that could be selected (38:20 - 38:23)
we felt that this took away some of the (38:21 - 38:26)
fun in battles based on our findings we (38:23 - 38:28)
have determined that ex license haven&#39;t (38:26 - 38:31)
been adding a new dimensionality of fun (38:28 - 38:34)
they love that word uh to unite battles (38:31 - 38:36)
and we are aiming for (38:34 - 38:38)
and what we were aiming for and (38:36 - 38:40)
fundamentally a revision is necessary (38:38 - 38:42)
therefore ex license classification will (38:40 - 38:46)
be removed with the September 2024 (38:42 - 38:48)
update the following Pokemon will be (38:46 - 38:52)
rebalanced zachian mega meww X mega meww (38:48 - 38:53)
y (38:52 - 38:56)
maridon I&#39;m assuming ho oh because ho (38:53 - 38:59)
was EX (38:56 - 38:59)
um This Is My Jam this is my song this (39:00 - 39:05)
is the song very excited for our audio (39:03 - 39:08)
listeners Greg was dancing I saw it (39:05 - 39:11)
but but some of these Pokemon existed (39:08 - 39:14)
before ex and then were categorizes ex (39:11 - 39:17)
and now they&#39;re removing ex so as I I (39:14 - 39:19)
understand the excitement Greg but I (39:17 - 39:24)
also the the the bitterness In Me (39:19 - 39:28)
Is they were still overpowered before e (39:24 - 39:31)
ex so how much are they actually going (39:28 - 39:34)
to change so I mean the ex came around (39:31 - 39:35)
because they were refus they were (39:34 - 39:37)
leaving them overpowered and refusing to (39:35 - 39:41)
do anything about it so ex was like (39:37 - 39:43)
they&#39;re sort of oh we&#39;re going classify (39:41 - 39:45)
them as ex and we&#39;re going to leave them (39:43 - 39:46)
overpowered we don&#39;t have to worry about (39:45 - 39:49)
balancing them and it&#39;s funny because (39:46 - 39:50)
like new players loved it yeah because (39:49 - 39:52)
new players could jump in grab the (39:50 - 39:54)
Pokemon and then nuke everything on the (39:52 - 39:56)
field you hit one button and then you (39:54 - 39:59)
won of course new players loved it but (39:56 - 40:01)
anybody who played the (39:59 - 40:04)
game beyond that quickly just it was (40:01 - 40:08)
they were just a drag it just was awful (40:04 - 40:09)
to play against especially if you know (40:08 - 40:14)
you win against zachian meww Y and (40:09 - 40:16)
maridon on the same team and then a (40:14 - 40:18)
Blissey you&#39;re like well this is just (40:16 - 40:21)
going to be awful this is absolutely no (40:18 - 40:24)
fun um and so they have been dodging (40:21 - 40:28)
this balancing of these Pokemon by lab B (40:24 - 40:30)
them EX for almost a year now where (40:28 - 40:31)
they&#39;re like well it&#39;s fine that they&#39;re (40:30 - 40:33)
overpowered they&#39;re ex and then we&#39;ll (40:31 - 40:35)
just ban (40:33 - 40:38)
them when was wasn&#39;t there a thing where (40:35 - 40:40)
you could only have one ex on your team (40:38 - 40:44)
yeah so when they are in master rank but (40:40 - 40:47)
it&#39;s in master rank only that was the (40:44 - 40:50)
other problem all of most of the game (40:47 - 40:52)
you had to play against these really (40:50 - 40:55)
unbalanced unfund Pokemon and then you&#39;d (40:52 - 40:57)
get into master rank and it&#39;s like well (40:55 - 40:58)
suddenly the one that you&#39;ve been (40:57 - 41:00)
playing this entire time is banned or (40:58 - 41:02)
you can only have one of them and so (41:00 - 41:04)
people had no idea how to play any of (41:02 - 41:06)
the other ones because all they did was (41:04 - 41:09)
play this overpowered thing to Masters (41:06 - 41:10)
and then they got to Masters couldn&#39;t (41:09 - 41:12)
play the thing they&#39;ve been playing and (41:10 - 41:14)
now everybody in Masters is suffering (41:12 - 41:16)
because you don&#39;t have something else to (41:14 - 41:18)
fall back on I see that makes sense of (41:16 - 41:21)
why they they explained it that way yes (41:18 - 41:23)
so it (41:21 - 41:26)
just especially when they got banned so (41:23 - 41:28)
you&#39;d play Mewtwo all way up to Masters (41:26 - 41:30)
and suddenly it was banned and you (41:28 - 41:32)
couldn&#39;t play it in Masters anymore and (41:30 - 41:34)
then everybody in Masters was struggling (41:32 - 41:36)
with people learning new Pokemon and (41:34 - 41:37)
trying to F figure out what they were (41:36 - 41:41)
doing it it because they refused to (41:37 - 41:44)
balance them caused more problems for (41:41 - 41:48)
longtime players that I think good and (41:44 - 41:49)
universally this is the thing that we&#39;ve (41:48 - 41:52)
all been waiting for like just take it (41:49 - 41:55)
away and balance them like every other (41:52 - 41:58)
Pokemon in the game like Buzz wall can (41:55 - 42:01)
be completely broken karant can be (41:58 - 42:03)
completely broken sometimes better than (42:01 - 42:06)
the ex&#39;s but you you refuse to sort of (42:03 - 42:08)
do the work to (42:06 - 42:12)
bring these five special Pokemon in line (42:08 - 42:16)
with everything else so it&#39;s just been (42:12 - 42:18)
an (42:16 - 42:21)
ongoing drag on your (42:18 - 42:23)
existing group of people and of course (42:21 - 42:26)
they can&#39;t do the bounces till till uh (42:23 - 42:28)
September because worlds is coming up (42:26 - 42:31)
and they can&#39;t risk worlds they can&#39;t (42:28 - 42:33)
undo what everybody who&#39;s been training (42:31 - 42:35)
to go into Worlds with these Pokemon and (42:33 - 42:38)
these ex these the way the game is now (42:35 - 42:40)
so post worlds this is going to go in (42:38 - 42:43)
and hopefully we&#39;ll just we&#39;ll finally (42:40 - 42:46)
get balance across the board plus we&#39;ll (42:43 - 42:48)
get to it in next but it also makes more (42:46 - 42:51)
sense in in what they say in the next (42:48 - 42:54)
parts of of the of the (42:51 - 42:58)
letter uh that says with a roster of (42:54 - 43:00)
over 60 Pok√©mon to choose from some have (42:58 - 43:02)
unfortunately not received many (43:00 - 43:05)
adjustments while some have seen uh some (43:02 - 43:08)
have been seen as Staples in battles (43:05 - 43:09)
because of this we want to make sure (43:08 - 43:10)
everyone can play their favorite Pokemon (43:09 - 43:13)
we making balance adjustments once a (43:10 - 43:15)
month and making small adjustments in (43:13 - 43:17)
between to ensure a fresh battle (43:15 - 43:21)
experience it&#39;s like been a year since (43:17 - 43:24)
eligos has had a major update of any (43:21 - 43:26)
kind and that&#39;s my main and so it&#39;s just (43:24 - 43:30)
like every Pat I&#39;m like okay well I&#39;m (43:26 - 43:32)
still playing the every everybody&#39;s (43:30 - 43:34)
moving in and out things are getting (43:32 - 43:37)
better except for we have to elos is (43:34 - 43:39)
what you&#39;re saying all right yeah I mean (43:37 - 43:43)
they did they did uh Nerf part of os&#39;s (43:39 - 43:46)
thing but haven&#39;t buffed it the biggest (43:43 - 43:48)
issue is (43:46 - 43:51)
just you go through sections where they (43:48 - 43:55)
have so greatly increased some that a (43:51 - 43:57)
lot of others are just you you just (43:55 - 43:59)
you&#39;re not going to play them like for a (43:57 - 44:00)
long time it&#39;s like oh there&#39;s a (43:59 - 44:03)
Garchomp on my team well I guess we lose (44:00 - 44:06)
because they hadn&#39;t touched Garchomp in (44:03 - 44:08)
gch used to be the (44:06 - 44:10)
play yeah used to be well it&#39;s getting (44:08 - 44:12)
back there again but that&#39;s part of the (44:10 - 44:14)
problem they just haven&#39;t been looking (44:12 - 44:17)
at the entire roster because they (44:14 - 44:20)
they&#39;ve been really focused on these are (44:17 - 44:23)
the Pokemon that our unite leagues use (44:20 - 44:24)
and so we&#39;re going to give all of our (44:23 - 44:26)
attention to them and everything else (44:24 - 44:30)
fell behind so with getting rid of EX (44:26 - 44:31)
plus saying they&#39;re going to start (44:30 - 44:34)
balancing every month there&#39;s a hope (44:31 - 44:37)
that a lot more things will be better (44:34 - 44:40)
for the general play groups for people (44:37 - 44:41)
who just play at the game who aren&#39;t (44:40 - 44:42)
ever looking to be in a tournament who (44:41 - 44:44)
are just looking to play their favorite (44:42 - 44:47)
Pokemon and have (44:44 - 44:52)
fun uh uh hot take uh I I I think this (44:47 - 44:55)
balancing every month does not last long (44:52 - 44:57)
this reminds me of this this reminds me (44:55 - 45:00)
of Niantic saying we&#39;re going to we&#39;re (44:57 - 45:02)
going to send out an update every month (45:00 - 45:03)
giving you behind the scenes of what&#39;s (45:02 - 45:05)
happening and it lasted exactly like (45:03 - 45:07)
three months before they gave up on it (45:05 - 45:10)
uh the only reason I say that is (45:07 - 45:13)
because um other games um will is here (45:10 - 45:14)
so I&#39;m going to use Destiny as an (45:13 - 45:17)
example Des Bungie did this with Destiny (45:14 - 45:18)
they were like we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna (45:17 - 45:21)
we&#39;re going to hot fix guns (45:18 - 45:23)
quicker and that&#39;s going to make The (45:21 - 45:26)
Crucible a better experience because (45:23 - 45:28)
instead of SOS running around everywhere (45:26 - 45:32)
we&#39;re going to tweak these guns uh and (45:28 - 45:35)
it didn&#39;t work like there like (45:32 - 45:38)
you I love the optimism of like we&#39;re (45:35 - 45:39)
going to update every month and we&#39;re (45:38 - 45:41)
going to do minor tweaks but a meta is (45:39 - 45:45)
still a meta and like things will just (45:41 - 45:48)
rise and be good and until you severely (45:45 - 45:49)
Nerf them they will stay I me there&#39;s (45:48 - 45:52)
also the additional issue of right is (45:49 - 45:54)
the meta the way it is because the (45:52 - 45:56)
particular item like the particular gun (45:54 - 45:59)
or Pok√©mon is overpowered or is it the (45:56 - 46:02)
way it is because player skills are able (45:59 - 46:06)
to facilitate anything to be good um and (46:02 - 46:08)
if they keep balancing The Meta (46:06 - 46:10)
repeatedly people who are only good (46:08 - 46:12)
because they can play one Pokemon really (46:10 - 46:15)
really well are going to (46:12 - 46:15)
leave because they don&#39;t want to keep (46:15 - 46:19)
learning new Pokemon right it&#39;s the same (46:17 - 46:21)
thing with Destiny right I don&#39;t want to (46:19 - 46:24)
have to keep learning a new gun I want (46:21 - 46:26)
to get the best gun and play that one (46:24 - 46:29)
this my (46:26 - 46:31)
exactly I mean the only thing that sort (46:29 - 46:36)
of I would put a little bit of a caveat (46:31 - 46:39)
on that is their season cycle is about a (46:36 - 46:43)
month and a half (46:39 - 46:47)
so I can see them sort of after every (46:43 - 46:49)
season reviewing what happened in that (46:47 - 46:51)
season and doing the minor changes that (46:49 - 46:53)
they&#39;re talking about over the board (46:51 - 46:56)
like they get a lot of data in each (46:53 - 47:00)
season so I kind of see I I think once a (46:56 - 47:02)
month is (47:00 - 47:06)
probably pie in the eye p in the you&#39;re (47:02 - 47:09)
right it is pie in the ey (47:06 - 47:13)
yeah hate when I get pie in my eyes yeah (47:09 - 47:16)
I mixed it up with the song uh that&#39;s a (47:13 - 47:21)
Mor uh but I do think hopefully they&#39;re (47:16 - 47:23)
that they are looking at after every (47:21 - 47:26)
season we are going to start looking at (47:23 - 47:28)
how that season went making a change (47:26 - 47:30)
making changes I think like a month and (47:28 - 47:32)
a half is far more realistic and (47:30 - 47:34)
something they would actually (47:32 - 47:37)
do um they also say we believe that the (47:34 - 47:39)
best way to drive change in unite (47:37 - 47:40)
battles is by adding new playable (47:39 - 47:43)
Pokemon to Pokemon unite we while we (47:40 - 47:45)
introduced fewer Pokemon in 2024 than (47:43 - 47:47)
previous years we plan to pick up the (47:45 - 47:50)
pace uh following the 2024 World (47:47 - 47:52)
Championships in August so please look (47:50 - 47:54)
forward to having more Pokemon join the (47:52 - 47:57)
unite roster later this year and finally (47:54 - 47:59)
we as we celebrate our third anniversary (47:57 - 48:00)
want to thank you for your feedback (47:59 - 48:02)
you&#39;ve provided your passion and (48:00 - 48:04)
continued support is important our team (48:02 - 48:05)
will continue to take on challenges in (48:04 - 48:10)
order to meet your expectations so that (48:05 - 48:15)
was their update thank you tpci garbage (48:10 - 48:18)
King I it I mean I&#39;d said before that it (48:15 - 48:20)
felt like we were just not getting (48:18 - 48:22)
Pokemon this year like the drip was so (48:20 - 48:26)
small I remember yes so I&#39;m hopeful that (48:22 - 48:29)
they pick it back up again I think (48:26 - 48:31)
that&#39;s (48:29 - 48:34)
also what like I I also they tend to do (48:31 - 48:36)
balances around new Pokemon so if they (48:34 - 48:40)
do a new Pokemon every three weeks um I (48:36 - 48:41)
can see them also being like we&#39;re (48:40 - 48:43)
introducing new Pokemon let&#39;s make a (48:41 - 48:45)
couple of minor changes and calling that (48:43 - 48:48)
we&#39;ve updated (48:45 - 48:50)
um but I I I am excited that they will (48:48 - 48:53)
add more like what League of Legends has (48:50 - 48:54)
8 (48:53 - 48:56)
million Pokemon unite can pick up the (48:54 - 48:59)
pace (48:56 - 49:01)
uh they (48:59 - 49:02)
do (49:01 - 49:05)
um yeah three three years of unite what (49:02 - 49:08)
was it four years of Cafe remix we (49:05 - 49:13)
talked about last week one year of (49:08 - 49:17)
sleep what else is there Masters is in (49:13 - 49:19)
Masters is hitting there September yeah (49:17 - 49:22)
Masters is end of August beginning of (49:19 - 49:25)
September yeah and Masters will be four (49:22 - 49:28)
yep um (49:25 - 49:30)
so oh I also want to say for people the (49:28 - 49:32)
hoo thing is (49:30 - 49:38)
live the solo Q is live doing doing the (49:32 - 49:42)
things in Solo Q counts if you have (49:38 - 49:44)
never played an attacker or a Defender (49:42 - 49:47)
and it says play a play a defender in (49:44 - 49:51)
one game go into casual solo queue it (49:47 - 49:53)
will count it and you can still move up (49:51 - 49:55)
the board you do not have to do it in (49:53 - 49:57)
ranked you don&#39;t have to do it (49:55 - 50:03)
unless the the board Mission says play A (49:57 - 50:05)
ranked battle you can do all the things (50:03 - 50:08)
solo by yourself and make progress to (50:05 - 50:11)
getting hoo for free so now is the time (50:08 - 50:13)
to jump in if you want to get hoo and (50:11 - 50:16)
you don&#39;t want to pay for it solo Q is (50:13 - 50:20)
available it&#39;s easy to do on casual and (50:16 - 50:24)
it counts towards the goals (50:20 - 50:24)
uh got it let&#39;s uh switch over (50:27 - 50:32)
to Pokemon (50:30 - 50:35)
go yeah where&#39;re at my Crocs (50:32 - 50:37)
news (50:35 - 50:39)
we I want to get Pokemon go out of the (50:37 - 50:42)
way I know I know everyone&#39;s at the edge (50:39 - 50:46)
of their seat for the Croc news I know (50:42 - 50:49)
um because goest is over entire (50:46 - 50:53)
time because goest is over we had some (50:49 - 50:56)
bonuses added one of those bonuses were (50:53 - 50:59)
tand mouse was added to the (50:56 - 51:04)
game um so you can go find a tandem (50:59 - 51:06)
Mouse it&#39;s a one in 100 chance to get a (51:04 - 51:09)
family of three a 99 out of 100 chance (51:06 - 51:11)
for a family of (51:09 - 51:15)
four um man the Pokemon that ruins (51:11 - 51:17)
scarlet and violet for me right there go (51:15 - 51:20)
ahead put it in Pokemon (51:17 - 51:23)
go you oh no no no I don&#39;t like (51:20 - 51:27)
you because I said I said (51:23 - 51:29)
people have been giving me too many (51:27 - 51:32)
spoilers of scarlet and violet it&#39;s (51:29 - 51:34)
ruining the game for me and then you (51:32 - 51:36)
were like well what what&#39;s been your F (51:34 - 51:38)
favorite Pokemon in the game so far and (51:36 - 51:39)
I think I was like oh you know the (51:38 - 51:43)
little grass fire dude and you&#39;re like (51:39 - 51:46)
the mice are really cute and I was like (51:43 - 51:48)
I haven&#39;t seen any mice so now you&#39;ve (51:46 - 51:52)
ruined the mice for me thank you and I (51:48 - 51:54)
came across them once and I said these (51:52 - 51:56)
are the ones Steve was talking about and (51:54 - 51:57)
I turned it off (51:56 - 52:00)
never played it again never that&#39;s first (51:57 - 52:03)
off half of that story is fabricated (52:00 - 52:06)
secondly we saw the mice in the one (52:03 - 52:09)
which trated oh that I liked the fire (52:06 - 52:13)
grass dude the (52:09 - 52:13)
jalapeno know his name now (52:15 - 52:21)
jalapeno (52:18 - 52:24)
jalapeno um I think the ultra bonus (52:21 - 52:27)
unlocks right SK villain yes (52:24 - 52:30)
Cas Cas Casp kid (52:27 - 52:34)
casid I don&#39;t think the ultra unlock (52:30 - 52:38)
bonuses were that great (52:34 - 52:41)
um I think I think most pokemon fans (52:38 - 52:43)
know whether they like or don&#39;t like (52:41 - 52:47)
Lucario that Mega Lucario is incredibly (52:43 - 52:52)
popular um so it is making its raid (52:47 - 52:55)
debut on Saturday July 27th from 11: to (52:52 - 52:59)
5: uh Mega Lucario will be more (52:55 - 53:01)
frequently appearing in raids you will (52:59 - 53:03)
get five free raid passes increased (53:01 - 53:06)
chance for shiny Lucario I think for (53:03 - 53:08)
these P rate events it&#39;s like a one in (53:06 - 53:11)
10 chance or something like (53:08 - 53:12)
that (53:11 - 53:16)
um 1.5 more XP from battles increased (53:12 - 53:18)
chance of getting rare candy XL from (53:16 - 53:20)
inperson raid battles inperson raid (53:18 - 53:22)
battles not remote and but you can (53:20 - 53:26)
remote for $2 you can remote up to 20 (53:22 - 53:28)
times from Friday to Saturday if you (53:26 - 53:30)
care to do so I would just want to point (53:28 - 53:31)
out though they were saying specifically (53:30 - 53:34)
increased chance of XL rare candy from (53:31 - 53:36)
in-person raid (53:34 - 53:41)
battles and they&#39;ll add a Lucario mask (53:36 - 53:43)
um we&#39;re really running out of Megas (53:41 - 53:49)
here we have camerupt and Sharpedo which (53:43 - 53:51)
makes sense if they&#39;re holding on to (53:49 - 53:53)
those if there&#39;s going to be a Team Aqua (53:51 - 53:56)
Team Magma day I guess do we have mega (53:53 - 54:00)
Sabal yet yet we don&#39;t have mega Sab eye (53:56 - 54:01)
uh we don&#39;t have (54:00 - 54:06)
aino oh yeah um and we don&#39;t have Mewtwo (54:01 - 54:08)
and there&#39;s no way they&#39;re they&#39;re (54:06 - 54:12)
saving Mewtwo for a go Fest or a Kanto (54:08 - 54:15)
tour 2.0 it&#39;s the 30th anniversary in (54:12 - 54:20)
2026 that&#39;s when it&#39;s going to happen (54:15 - 54:23)
um we don&#39;t have Mega Metagross either (54:20 - 54:28)
uh true which Metagross Beedrill yes (54:23 - 54:30)
that was the free one oh yeah that&#39;s (54:28 - 54:33)
right we have make a p so (54:30 - 54:36)
long they&#39;ve really miled megas for the (54:33 - 54:38)
last four years and now there&#39;s going to (54:36 - 54:40)
be a whole bunch of new Megas in uh (54:38 - 54:45)
Pokemon Za yeah and in zah that&#39;s true (54:40 - 54:47)
yeah there ideally there would be more (54:45 - 54:51)
me I spoke to the folks at game freak (54:47 - 54:54)
and they told me they&#39;re using this (54:51 - 54:56)
opportunity to rebalance the megas and (54:54 - 54:58)
add additional (54:56 - 55:00)
megas they were like Pokemon go is (54:58 - 55:02)
running out of Megas let&#39;s make a main (55:00 - 55:05)
Series game to introduce more megas (55:02 - 55:07)
yep part of the (55:05 - 55:10)
cycle I I I think this is fine like (55:07 - 55:12)
Lucario raid day I really thought they (55:10 - 55:14)
were going to do like Lucario in like a (55:12 - 55:17)
go Fest or something or not just give it (55:14 - 55:23)
a raid day but sure I guess better than (55:17 - 55:25)
they&#39;ve got to get the old megas cleared (55:23 - 55:27)
out before they start bring bringing in (55:25 - 55:29)
the new ones they could be like a little (55:27 - 55:31)
bit of an overlap they&#39;ll save like the (55:29 - 55:34)
really good megas like mega save Ali for (55:31 - 55:36)
like the overlap period but they got to (55:34 - 55:38)
get most of this stuff cleared out (55:36 - 55:41)
inventory price to (55:38 - 55:41)
[Laughter] (55:43 - 55:48)
go uh also starting next week um July (55:45 - 55:51)
25th there will be the strength of steel (55:48 - 55:55)
event which will have the togu Dum Maru (55:51 - 55:58)
debut shiny de (55:55 - 55:58)
sorry alolan sandrew Magnemite pineco (55:58 - 56:05)
nose pass Aeron Beldum bronzer F ra seed (56:01 - 56:09)
uh Garian stunfisk togaru will all be (56:05 - 56:11)
appearing if you&#39;re lucky trainers you (56:09 - 56:13)
may encounter a shiny togaru if you have (56:11 - 56:16)
not seen shiny togaru you&#39;re in for a (56:13 - 56:19)
world of disappointment it is one of the (56:16 - 56:20)
worst (56:19 - 56:24)
shinies they they have done is it worse (56:20 - 56:25)
than (56:24 - 56:28)
Gastly yes (56:25 - 56:28)
Gastly in Pokemon Go&#39;s shiny actually (56:28 - 56:33)
looks pretty good I would say that (56:30 - 56:36)
togaru is like borderline on par with (56:33 - 56:41)
ell kid for being a bad shiny o I have (56:36 - 56:42)
to look it&#39;s not (56:41 - 56:46)
great it makes it makes like shocking (56:42 - 56:48)
difference between like Den shiny and (56:46 - 56:50)
togu dearu shiny like Den shiny one of (56:48 - 56:52)
the (56:50 - 56:52)
best it&#39;s bad it just turns brown (56:53 - 57:01)
right (56:59 - 57:04)
togaru yeah it it becomes like a lighter (57:01 - 57:09)
yeah gray color well I mean I guess it (57:04 - 57:12)
looks more Brown to me but I&#39;m not there (57:09 - 57:14)
yet you guys are hogging up on my (57:12 - 57:19)
internet I can barely load a a JPEG (57:14 - 57:24)
here live reaction to shiny to (57:19 - 57:28)
Maru it&#39;s it&#39;s barely different B (57:24 - 57:31)
why why you get out (57:28 - 57:31)
bed the biggest thing that they could do (57:36 - 57:42)
for Gen 10 is rework rework all of the (57:38 - 57:45)
shines get rid of half the greens no I (57:42 - 57:47)
would I would rather have an ugly green (57:45 - 57:49)
than whatever they did to tood dearu (57:47 - 57:51)
just make togaru an ugly green at that (57:49 - 57:53)
point it would be way better I mean it&#39;s (57:51 - 57:56)
also like the suru Ed shiny which I&#39;m (57:53 - 57:58)
like I have one and I can never (57:56 - 58:03)
tell oh the eye color yeah the eye color (57:58 - 58:06)
yeah yeah I I think these Ultra unlocks (58:03 - 58:10)
were not super great but it&#39;s fine I (58:06 - 58:12)
would also suspect we are recording this (58:10 - 58:15)
on July 20th I would Su maybe in the (58:12 - 58:17)
next week or two they&#39;re going to (58:15 - 58:18)
announce Safari zones I think when we (58:17 - 58:21)
looked at last Safari Zone announcements (58:18 - 58:24)
they were near the end of July they (58:21 - 58:25)
obviously don&#39;t want to announce them (58:24 - 58:28)
before go Fest cuz they want all eyes on (58:25 - 58:31)
go Fest and those specific events but I (58:28 - 58:34)
would I would guess there should be like (58:31 - 58:36)
three Safari zones for the rest of the (58:34 - 58:39)
year I don&#39;t know where they would be (58:36 - 58:42)
um Korea I I don&#39;t see why they would (58:39 - 58:45)
skip Korea at this point uh because one (58:42 - 58:47)
it&#39;s very easy for other Asian countries (58:45 - 58:49)
to travel to Korea (58:47 - 58:52)
two heck they did juu Island randomly (58:49 - 58:54)
one year I then then they did soul and (58:52 - 58:55)
then they did another and then they did (58:54 - 58:57)
goyang (58:55 - 58:59)
um so I think Korea is is probably on (58:57 - 59:02)
the list I would not be surprised if (58:59 - 59:04)
they went back to Mexico I think again (59:02 - 59:07)
very easy for Americans to get to um (59:04 - 59:11)
they&#39;ve done two or three events in (59:07 - 59:13)
Mexico they did that one that was on (59:11 - 59:16)
Pokemon day that kind of got can do you (59:13 - 59:17)
remember when they announced an event (59:16 - 59:19)
was it for like Saudi (59:17 - 59:22)
Arabia and then that one got (59:19 - 59:25)
cancelled um but the Mexico one still (59:22 - 59:27)
stayed what where what city was at I (59:25 - 59:29)
don&#39;t remember don&#39;t remember but then (59:27 - 59:31)
they did Mexico (59:29 - 59:34)
City uh I don&#39;t know where in Europe (59:31 - 59:36)
they would pick they picked Barcelona (59:34 - 59:37)
last (59:36 - 59:40)
time I could easily see them going back (59:37 - 59:41)
to (59:40 - 59:47)
Germany uh I saw rumors of maybe (59:41 - 59:47)
Italy I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know a lot of (59:47 - 59:51)
things about (59:50 - 59:54)
Italy maybe they have big (59:51 - 59:58)
parks um I Italy is nothing butt (59:54 - 60:01)
Parks parks and coliseums parks and (59:58 - 60:03)
coliseums in (60:01 - 60:06)
canals uh I don&#39;t think America for the (60:03 - 60:08)
record I I think we America doesn&#39;t get (60:06 - 60:11)
a Safari Zone because we get go (60:08 - 60:13)
tour but that&#39;s why I think they (60:11 - 60:16)
compromise with like Mexico because it&#39;s (60:13 - 60:19)
pretty close maybe they do Canada yeah (60:16 - 60:21)
Canada that I I what was the one they (60:19 - 60:25)
had in Canada that one time it was was (60:21 - 60:27)
it Ontario (60:25 - 60:29)
Montreal Montreal it was Montreal (60:27 - 60:33)
because people from New York drove to it (60:29 - 60:35)
yeah (60:33 - 60:37)
um Toronto (60:35 - 60:39)
Vancouver Toronto would probably make (60:37 - 60:42)
the most sense I (60:39 - 60:44)
think I go back to Toronto it&#39;s an (60:42 - 60:45)
expensive city but it was I mean (60:44 - 60:48)
Vancouver is even more expensive so (60:45 - 60:49)
let&#39;s not go there yeah Vancouver is (60:48 - 60:51)
more (60:49 - 60:53)
expensive they&#39;ve done what a world (60:51 - 60:56)
championship in Vancouver and a uh (60:53 - 61:00)
regionals I think in (60:56 - 61:00)
Vancouver um yeah I would I would expect (61:00 - 61:05)
three Safari (61:03 - 61:05)
zones (61:05 - 61:10)
and yeah (61:07 - 61:13)
maybe I think there&#39;re supposed to be an (61:10 - 61:16)
event in December in like Brazil heck (61:13 - 61:18)
yeah on my way and I think (61:16 - 61:20)
they&#39;re I think they&#39;re doing another (61:18 - 61:24)
Indonesian event soon as well I think (61:20 - 61:26)
it&#39;s the same stuff though where it&#39;s (61:24 - 61:29)
like the Bali Pikachu with the shirt and (61:26 - 61:31)
the Bali Pikachu with the balloons I (61:29 - 61:33)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s too different from that (61:31 - 61:36)
but I think they&#39;re repeating that um I (61:33 - 61:37)
guess if they don&#39;t do South Korea they (61:36 - 61:39)
could do like (61:37 - 61:41)
Taiwan um that&#39;s that&#39;s been a pretty (61:39 - 61:44)
popular place for Pokemon go also very (61:41 - 61:45)
popular for Pokemon sleep as we talked (61:44 - 61:48)
about last (61:45 - 61:51)
week so yeah I guess I guess they could (61:48 - 61:57)
do that um uh I think yeah uh that gives (61:51 - 62:01)
us we covered all our mobile games so (61:57 - 62:03)
let&#39;s take one more break and then we (62:01 - 62:06)

San Diego ComicCon is the international (63:34 - 63:38)
Park new or have it just not been paying (63:36 - 63:40)
attention to the as far as I remember it (63:38 - 63:43)
was only San Diego ComicCon yeah the (63:40 - 63:46)
logo says San Diego ComicCon (63:43 - 63:47)
International I feel like the (63:46 - 63:51)
international is new I agree I (63:47 - 63:54)
agree did that change what did that (63:51 - 63:56)
change where have I been gradually (63:54 - 64:00)
removing the comic part of it and it&#39;s (63:56 - 64:02)
just going to become San Diego con (64:00 - 64:05)
International International just an (64:02 - 64:07)
international con because as far as I (64:05 - 64:10)
know like all the actual comic book (64:07 - 64:13)
people are pushed into a corner (64:10 - 64:14)
somewhere yeah they&#39;re in a corner no (64:13 - 64:17)
nobody cares about them (64:14 - 64:19)
anymore uh they&#39;re saying that Pokemon (64:17 - 64:22)
will be a booth 235 and it will be an (64:19 - 64:24)
interactive walk through where fans will (64:22 - 64:26)
play the role as a trainer such starting (64:24 - 64:27)
off with their own Pokemon Adventure (64:26 - 64:29)
with the rising volt tacklers you can (64:27 - 64:33)
learn about the world and characters of (64:29 - 64:35)
Pokemon Horizons and you get to a chance (64:33 - 64:38)
to participate in giveaways for (64:35 - 64:40)
merchandise visitors at the booth will (64:38 - 64:42)
also be able to ver to purchase a (64:40 - 64:45)
variety of Pokemon Center (64:42 - 64:49)
products uh there will be demos of (64:45 - 64:52)
scarlet and (64:49 - 64:55)
violet um I mean I guess there will be (64:52 - 64:57)
more in depth demonstrations on shiny (64:55 - 65:00)
hunting training Pokemon for sevenstar (64:57 - 65:03)
raids in addition (65:00 - 65:06)
to uh visitors will also be able to pick (65:03 - 65:08)
up a code card for the mystery gift to (65:06 - 65:12)
receive Roy&#39;s Foy Coco these code cards (65:08 - 65:13)
will (65:12 - 65:16)
go out on the night preview night on (65:13 - 65:18)
July (65:16 - 65:21)
24th I would assume the code card would (65:18 - 65:24)
have the same mystery gift code as (65:21 - 65:27)
everyone else so even though they said (65:24 - 65:31)
on July 26 it&#39;ll be for everyone I can&#39;t (65:27 - 65:34)
imagine they would make unique codes for (65:31 - 65:37)
a Pokemon we&#39;re all getting yeah why (65:34 - 65:40)
would I mean why I mean the only way is (65:37 - 65:43)
to like track how many are used I (65:40 - 65:46)
guess like how much traction they got (65:43 - 65:48)
off of that I I guess like if they had (65:46 - 65:50)
unique codes but I like a lot of expense (65:48 - 65:53)
for that well I mean it&#39;s also weird (65:50 - 65:55)
that they&#39;re demoing scarlet and violet (65:53 - 65:57)
so maybe they&#39;re like trying to get in (65:55 - 66:00)
people who haven&#39;t played Pokemon in 40 (65:57 - 66:03)
years and they&#39;re like here&#39;s also a (66:00 - 66:05)
card for a special Pokemon that secretly (66:03 - 66:06)
we know you could have gotten over the (66:05 - 66:08)
internet but you don&#39;t know what the (66:06 - 66:11)
internet is yet so take a card I I don&#39;t (66:08 - 66:13)
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s that weird because (66:11 - 66:16)
at PA East they had demos of scarlet and (66:13 - 66:18)
violet and legends and the line for (66:16 - 66:21)
Legends was incredibly long they got to (66:18 - 66:23)
demo something yeah they to demo (66:21 - 66:25)
something the the demo for detective (66:23 - 66:29)
Pikachu not that long not that (66:25 - 66:29)

in (72:11 - 72:16)
2024 uh there was a Pikachu themed (72:13 - 72:18)
classic (72:16 - 72:21)
clog that came out and now they&#39;re (72:18 - 72:24)
expanding their collection with Gen one (72:21 - 72:27)
Pok√©mon featuring gang Charizard Snorlax (72:24 - 72:30)
and Jigglypuff I think last week I just (72:27 - 72:32)
somewhere I said recently that I feel (72:30 - 72:36)
like Jigglypuff&#39;s not that popular (72:32 - 72:38)
anymore here we are you are incorrect (72:36 - 72:43)
here we are eat eat that pie in your (72:38 - 72:43)
eye (72:44 - 72:47)
okay each each clog is enhanced with a (72:50 - 72:56)
unique jibbit charm to highlight the (72:54 - 72:58)
characteristic these charms include (72:56 - 73:00)
characters and other thematic events (72:58 - 73:03)
that evoke their distinct personality (73:00 - 73:07)
traits uh each clog has the sport mode (73:03 - 73:10)
strap and footed feature with the (73:07 - 73:12)
Pokemon pokeball (73:10 - 73:15)
logo and it looks like they are set to (73:12 - 73:19)
be $70 which I think is a $10 increase (73:15 - 73:21)
from the original Pokemon Crocs I&#39;m (73:19 - 73:23)
almost positive they were (73:21 - 73:27)
60 that does sound inre yeah like a (73:23 - 73:29)
regular Croc is usually around 50 right (73:27 - 73:32)
if you can&#39;t get it on sale like a black (73:29 - 73:36)
croc or a white Croc is like 50 (73:32 - 73:38)
bucks you gota wait for those clocks to (73:36 - 73:40)
be in the clearance bin for like (73:38 - 73:42)
25 but they order too many they never (73:40 - 73:45)
have my size in the clearance (73:42 - 73:48)
bin your Feet&#39;s too big (73:45 - 73:50)
correct um yeah so we have we have a (73:48 - 73:53)
Jigglypuff Croc which is just pink and (73:50 - 73:55)
white it comes with a Jigglypuff jig (73:53 - 73:57)
jbit which you could put that on any (73:55 - 73:59)
Croc but if you specifically want that (73:57 - 74:02)
usually the the jibbit which are the (73:59 - 74:04)
charms that you put in the Croc (74:02 - 74:07)
hole I&#39;m explaining I ha every moment of (74:04 - 74:11)
this The Croc ventilation yes you would (74:07 - 74:14)
you would put those jbits are exclusive (74:11 - 74:15)
to those Crocs so I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll (74:14 - 74:17)
be able to buy the Jigglypuff separately (74:15 - 74:20)
is what I&#39;m saying so the Jigglypuff COC (74:17 - 74:22)
pink and pink but what you can do is you (74:20 - 74:24)
go to the COC store you take the (74:22 - 74:27)
Jigglypuff off the Jigglypuff (74:24 - 74:29)
Croc put it in your (74:27 - 74:35)
pocket don&#39;t tell our viewers to (74:29 - 74:35)
steal this is why we can&#39;t have will on (74:35 - 74:41)
if they cared they&#39;d make them (74:38 - 74:44)
unstealable somehow the Charizard Croc (74:41 - 74:47)
is black and red with Charizard and like (74:44 - 74:50)
a little Fireball jibbit Gengar Croc is (74:47 - 74:53)
purple and black which is actually (74:50 - 74:54)
probably the one that looks the coolest (74:53 - 74:57)
with Gengar on it and then I don&#39;t know (74:54 - 74:59)
what that&#39;s supposed to be like a (74:57 - 75:01)
psychic wave (74:59 - 75:05)
jibbit um and then the Snorlax Croc is (75:01 - 75:07)
blue and white with Snorlax jibbit and (75:05 - 75:09)
then it looks like little Z&#39;s a little Z (75:07 - 75:12)
jibbit for sleeping uh it also has like (75:09 - 75:14)
a little flower like a gray and white (75:12 - 75:20)
flower on the Snorlax one yeah yeah the (75:14 - 75:26)
the the on the the Gengar one and the (75:20 - 75:27)
Charizard one (75:26 - 75:30)
whatever that (75:27 - 75:33)
side it looks like something you&#39;d go (75:30 - 75:35)
see a doctor about if you discovered it (75:33 - 75:38)
it&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s a little it&#39;s a (75:35 - 75:41)
little cyy oh something like I got a (75:38 - 75:46)
little rash going on here I need some (75:41 - 75:50)
ointment it this is fine like like I the (75:46 - 75:52)
Gen one stuff is really overplayed I (75:50 - 75:54)
don&#39;t really like connect with any four (75:52 - 75:56)
of these Pokemon (75:54 - 75:59)
Gengar gets more merch Than People (75:56 - 76:01)
realize there&#39;s just so much fine I (75:59 - 76:03)
would I would buy the Gengar Crocs and (76:01 - 76:05)
take the jibbit off and just wear the (76:03 - 76:08)
Gengar Crocs I think the Gengar Crocs (76:05 - 76:10)
would look better without the jibbit yes (76:08 - 76:14)
correct yeah I think this like Naruto (76:10 - 76:19)
star piece and the the the the psychic (76:14 - 76:22)
egg thing on the Gengar cracks just look (76:19 - 76:26)
awkward um believe it you know they did (76:22 - 76:29)
they did Crocs of like Frankenberry and (76:26 - 76:31)
boob Berry do you remember those and (76:29 - 76:34)
they were so good they do Crocs with (76:31 - 76:37)
lots of things but yeah these just the (76:34 - 76:39)
Naruto Crocs I don&#39;t even like Naruto I (76:37 - 76:42)
know nothing about Naruto and those (76:39 - 76:44)
Crocs were (76:42 - 76:46)
awesome these just seem (76:44 - 76:49)
very low effort you can get the (76:46 - 76:52)
Frankenberry Crocs on Amazon for 40 (76:49 - 76:57)
bucks there you go my issue is I like I (76:52 - 76:59)
only wear my Crocs when I&#39;m (76:57 - 77:03)
doing relatively destructive things like (76:59 - 77:05)
primarily like riding my bike right (77:03 - 77:07)
riding my bike that&#39;s that&#39;s where like (77:05 - 77:09)
Crocs are King if you&#39;re out doing a (77:07 - 77:12)
longdistance bike ride absolutely you (77:09 - 77:13)
don&#39;t want the shoes that like lock into (77:12 - 77:16)
your pedals I certainly do not for the (77:13 - 77:17)
number of times that I have fallen off (77:16 - 77:20)
my bike I don&#39;t want to lock into my (77:17 - 77:23)
bike ever um so I don&#39;t want to spend a (77:20 - 77:26)
lot of money on Crocs when I know that (77:23 - 77:29)
you know they might get sucked into a (77:26 - 77:31)
mud hole on the side of the Minnesota (77:29 - 77:34)
River like a previous pair of micro (77:31 - 77:38)
did where are you biking how are you on (77:34 - 77:40)
the banks of the Minnesota River clearly (77:38 - 77:42)
Mississippi there&#39;s been a mississipp (77:40 - 77:46)
hav noticed now see scrubs bike along (77:42 - 77:48)
the Mississippi because it&#39;s paved the (77:46 - 77:52)
Minnesota River is all dirt so oh yeah (77:48 - 77:56)

20 minute bike (79:29 - 79:34)
ride you have the option of having a (79:31 - 79:37)
little boost it&#39;s nice when you&#39;ve (79:34 - 79:39)
overextended yourself and you&#39;re super (79:37 - 79:41)
tired and you&#39;re like I just I just need (79:39 - 79:44)

into the banks of the Mississippi I want (79:53 - 79:58)
I want an electric bike that has a (79:55 - 80:00)
basket in the back but I can also take (79:58 - 80:02)

there so I could so like I could be like (80:02 - 80:07)
Greg let me give you a ride home the (80:05 - 80:11)
amazing thing about bikes is uh with a (80:07 - 80:14)

electric scooters they&#39;re fine like I&#39;ve (81:30 - 81:34)
definitely taken one from point A to (81:32 - 81:37)
point B and I was very cautious on them (81:34 - 81:39)
and didn&#39;t go nearly as fast as they (81:37 - 81:43)
could go but that&#39;s crazy talk two (81:39 - 81:45)
people on a scooter going like 20 miles (81:43 - 81:46)
an hour you&#39;re out of your with no (81:45 - 81:49)
