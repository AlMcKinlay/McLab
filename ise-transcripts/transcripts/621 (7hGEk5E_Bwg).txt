well slept as last time and that was (0:42 - 0:46)
when I got up earlier so that&#39;s a a bit (0:44 - 0:49)
of a bummer but it was a it was a late (0:46 - 0:51)
night last night so uh sleep sleep score (0:49 - 0:54)
not so great (0:51 - 0:57)
today well speaking of sleep we got some (0:54 - 1:00)
sleep news this is primarily a sleep (0:57 - 1:05)
podcast now and then uh we have some FBI (1:00 - 1:08)
news CU that makes sense with (1:05 - 1:08)
Pokemon there&#39;s some stuff regarding (1:09 - 1:18)
Pokemon go um scarlet and violet wise (1:13 - 1:21)
there was the Water Festival event which (1:18 - 1:23)
by the time this podcast goes up is is (1:21 - 1:26)
is gone came and came and went but (1:23 - 1:27)
that&#39;s still cool they&#39;re doing mass (1:26 - 1:29)
outbreaks uh this was the second week of (1:27 - 1:33)
Swampert came and went uh so whatever (1:29 - 1:37)
seven star will be next and then who (1:33 - 1:38)
knows maybe they&#39;ll announce that (1:37 - 1:40)
tonight because they usually announce (1:38 - 1:44)
that right after we&#39;re done recording so (1:40 - 1:47)
yep maybe it&#39;ll finally be subtile maybe (1:44 - 1:51)
that&#39;s yeah Steve&#39;s waiting Steve just (1:47 - 1:52)
Wai I&#39;m ready to hit publish on that (1:51 - 1:55)
video it is done the graphics are done (1:52 - 1:59)
the video is done watch them announce (1:55 - 2:01)
Electric septile (1:59 - 2:03)
[Laughter] (2:01 - 2:05)
which I guess I mean it gets Thunder (2:03 - 2:08)
Punch it would make (2:05 - 2:10)
sense Pokemon sleep let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s (2:08 - 2:13)
start there (2:10 - 2:17)
uh look if you&#39;re listening to this (2:13 - 2:20)
podcast and you&#39;re gonna like write a (2:17 - 2:23)
review and say like the the the hosts (2:20 - 2:26)
are so negative they hate Pokemon you (2:23 - 2:28)
are clearly skipping the first 30 (2:26 - 2:31)
minutes of the show every single week (2:28 - 2:33)
because Pokemon sleep is one of the best (2:31 - 2:37)
games and I cannot praise it enough of (2:33 - 2:40)
how good it is how exciting I am every (2:37 - 2:43)
morning how I&#39;m not upset I&#39;m giving it (2:40 - 2:46)
$10 a month in the battle fast season (2:43 - 2:51)
pass or the Pokemon sleep battle (2:46 - 2:51)
pass there we are the most positive (2:52 - 2:58)
podcast when it comes to Pokemon sleep (2:55 - 3:00)
maybe the only podcast covering Pokemon (2:58 - 3:05)
sleep yeah but it&#39;s a great game it&#39;s (3:00 - 3:08)
fantastic and when even when I say all (3:05 - 3:10)
that when you&#39;re like man how could they (3:08 - 3:12)
make this game any (3:10 - 3:19)
better they did crar is coming to the (3:12 - 3:22)
game one week (3:19 - 3:24)
away oh (3:22 - 3:28)
boy it&#39;s like they know you talk about (3:24 - 3:30)
Pokemon sleep more than any other po (3:28 - 3:34)
game genuinely I really hope I don&#39;t (3:30 - 3:35)
know how many people work at select (3:34 - 3:38)
button I I feel like last I heard it was (3:35 - 3:40)
only like six people work there but I (3:38 - 3:43)
hope one of those six people listen to (3:40 - 3:45)
this (3:43 - 3:45)
podcast uh how many times were you told (3:47 - 3:52)
the other day that CR rant was coming to (3:50 - 3:54)
Pokemon sleep I feel like every every (3:52 - 3:56)
platform I went on there were only (3:54 - 3:59)
people telling Steve that crar was (3:56 - 4:01)
coming (3:59 - 4:05)
um ironically enough I woke up from a (4:01 - 4:07)
nap (4:05 - 4:09)
uh and presumably you weren&#39;t tracking (4:07 - 4:11)
your sleep in Pokemon sleep during no I (4:09 - 4:14)
don&#39;t like to track my naps uh it&#39;s not (4:11 - 4:17)
good strategy not a good Strat I don&#39;t (4:14 - 4:19)
know how many people work at select (4:17 - 4:21)
button I have no clue it doesn&#39;t say (4:19 - 4:23)
anymore to imagine it&#39;s more than is it (4:21 - 4:25)
more than six though really I they&#39;re (4:23 - 4:28)
they&#39;re a really small company yeah but (4:25 - 4:31)
six is really really small I mean look (4:28 - 4:33)
at the guy who made stardy (4:31 - 4:36)
Valley (4:33 - 4:39)
yeah (4:36 - 4:41)
still they don&#39;t have a you know they (4:39 - 4:43)
only have four games under their belt (4:41 - 4:45)
and I don&#39;t think survive mola Moola was (4:43 - 4:48)
employing like 20 (4:45 - 4:50)
people you never know have you played (4:48 - 4:52)
survive (4:50 - 4:54)
mola you (4:52 - 4:57)
know I (4:54 - 4:57)
haven&#39;t uh so the news was posted like (4:57 - 5:02)
10 minutes after I woke (5:00 - 5:07)
up so I I I I got I got the I got the (5:02 - 5:10)
complete the fill of it pretty (5:07 - 5:12)
quickly if you work at select button (5:10 - 5:14)
please let us know how many people work (5:12 - 5:16)
for your company I don&#39;t think they&#39;re (5:14 - 5:18)
going to do that but maybe well then see (5:16 - 5:19)
then I don&#39;t have to ask if they listen (5:18 - 5:21)
to the podcast because when they reach (5:19 - 5:22)
out to say there&#39;s only six people (5:21 - 5:24)
working then that confirms they also (5:22 - 5:27)
listen to the podcast it&#39;s like two (5:24 - 5:31)
birds one stone uh (5:27 - 5:33)
yes a lot of people told me Kar was (5:31 - 5:36)
coming there&#39;s a whole event coming uh (5:33 - 5:38)
the Summer Festival (5:36 - 5:41)
event which uh is going to be a weekl (5:38 - 5:43)
long event featuring water flying and (5:41 - 5:45)
bug type (5:43 - 5:47)
Pokemon not sure why they needed to (5:45 - 5:49)
include bug types in (5:47 - 5:52)
there it&#39;s the summer thing it&#39;s the (5:49 - 5:54)
time of year when all the cicas come out (5:52 - 5:57)
and places there are cicas and all of (5:54 - 5:59)
that the re the real twist would have (5:57 - 6:01)
been adding (5:59 - 6:05)
[Laughter] (6:01 - 6:10)
N I guess I feel like bugs are all year (6:05 - 6:14)
long but isn&#39;t it but there are more (6:10 - 6:17)
this is like the time when the bugs are (6:14 - 6:19)
yeah isn&#39;t this supposed to be a really (6:17 - 6:21)
bad year for cicas yeah because there&#39;s (6:19 - 6:23)
two different yeah I&#39;m not going to get (6:21 - 6:25)
this right but there&#39;s like two (6:23 - 6:28)
different types that are going to be (6:25 - 6:29)
hatching or whatever hatching at the (6:28 - 6:31)
same time or something like that so it&#39;s (6:29 - 6:33)
like more than it even normally would be (6:31 - 6:35)
didn&#39;t that happened four years ago I (6:33 - 6:36)
don&#39;t (6:35 - 6:39)
know I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know the I (6:36 - 6:41)
there&#39;s two the moon cycles in my (6:39 - 6:44)
calendar I don&#39;t have the cicada (6:41 - 6:44)
Cycles uh this Summer Festival event (6:46 - 6:52)
will feature uh a limited time function (6:49 - 6:55)
of the candy cromatic it&#39;s really cool (6:52 - 6:58)
that like the cromatic is coming to (6:55 - 7:01)
another game like they us it again (6:58 - 7:03)
that&#39;s awesome it&#39;s not just karant (7:01 - 7:05)
that&#39;s coming to Pokemon sleep it&#39;s also (7:03 - 7:06)
the (7:05 - 7:08)
cromatic uh this function allows you to (7:06 - 7:12)
get m-sized candy of various types by (7:08 - 7:14)
feeding dream shards and Pokemon candies (7:12 - 7:16)
to the candy (7:14 - 7:19)
cromatic uh before we go any further I&#39;m (7:16 - 7:22)
just going to explain how this works uh (7:19 - 7:26)
you can put any candy into the (7:22 - 7:29)
cromatic and then turn that into (7:26 - 7:31)
something else so so for example let&#39;s (7:29 - 7:34)
say there are some Pokemon in the game (7:31 - 7:37)
that are completely garbage like Gulpin (7:34 - 7:39)
and you would have no reason to ever (7:37 - 7:42)
power up a Gulpin you could take all (7:39 - 7:44)
your Gulpin candy which you should not (7:42 - 7:46)
be using at all you should not be (7:44 - 7:48)
powering up any Gulpin and then you can (7:46 - 7:50)
put that in the cromatic and then that (7:48 - 7:52)
should give (7:50 - 7:56)
you poison medium candy back that then (7:52 - 7:58)
you could put into a different poison (7:56 - 8:00)
Pokemon which I think the best poison (7:58 - 8:02)
Pokemon in the game is like (8:00 - 8:05)
krunk I think because it gets you like (8:02 - 8:08)
oil um there&#39;s probably something else (8:05 - 8:10)
that I&#39;m not think don&#39;t say Venusaur (8:08 - 8:11)
venusaur&#39;s grass there&#39;s only single (8:10 - 8:13)
type Pokemon in the game are there any (8:11 - 8:15)
other poison type Pokemon in the game (8:13 - 8:17)
other than Gulpin and (8:15 - 8:20)
krunk ah I you know that&#39;s a good (8:17 - 8:23)
question I don&#39;t not that I&#39;m thinking (8:20 - 8:27)
of cuz there&#39;s no poison well ekin ah (8:23 - 8:29)
but ekin you should also be putting into (8:27 - 8:33)
the C Amic as well well then what&#39;s the (8:29 - 8:34)
I mean for the poison yeah I just got (8:33 - 8:38)
kro gun conkin I don&#39;t even have a I (8:34 - 8:40)
have like a th000 Jigglypuff candy and (8:38 - 8:44)
my Wiggly tff is like level 53 or (8:40 - 8:47)
something and it can only go to 55 I (8:44 - 8:49)
don&#39;t think that&#39;s worth going into the (8:47 - 8:51)
cromatic personally because eventually (8:49 - 8:54)
they&#39;ll raise that level cap yeah and (8:51 - 8:56)
you&#39;re going to want that candy yeah I (8:54 - 8:59)
do have like a thousand Rattata candy (8:56 - 9:02)
and I know rat r ricade is like a Bish (8:59 - 9:04)
Pokemon in the game like even if you had (9:02 - 9:07)
the best radicate it&#39;s still not (9:04 - 9:09)
like something you&#39;re like not something (9:07 - 9:11)
you&#39;re GNA have on your team yeah yeah (9:09 - 9:13)
you would have it on like Tundra but (9:11 - 9:15)
even (9:13 - 9:17)
so not completely (9:15 - 9:21)
amazing um but I would probably maybe (9:17 - 9:23)
put I don&#39;t know like Kangaskhan would (9:21 - 9:24)
be a better normal type Pokemon so you (9:23 - 9:27)
could probably grind up your ricade put (9:24 - 9:30)
it in Kangaskhan or poor (9:27 - 9:32)
rate like Meowth is another Pokemon that (9:30 - 9:35)
you would like literally here here&#39;s (9:32 - 9:37)
your tip any Pokemon where their main (9:35 - 9:40)
skill is dream Shard bonus I&#39;m looking (9:37 - 9:44)
at you Riolu Riolu no oh no those are (9:40 - 9:46)
all Pokemon that you can (9:44 - 9:49)
grind candy up for CU unless there&#39;s (9:46 - 9:52)
like a severe boost to dream Shard bonus (9:49 - 9:56)
those Pokemon are just bad (9:52 - 9:58)
currently (9:56 - 10:00)
yeah yep for real (9:58 - 10:04)
uh I guess it makes so recently I don&#39;t (10:00 - 10:07)
know which update it was but they added (10:04 - 10:09)
to when you open up your bag you now (10:07 - 10:11)
have the ingredients option the items (10:09 - 10:13)
option and then the Pokemon candies (10:11 - 10:17)
option so that is nice now looking at (10:13 - 10:19)
thinking about like being able to (10:17 - 10:21)
quickly see what you have a lot of candy (10:19 - 10:23)
of or what you need to what you&#39;re going (10:21 - 10:25)
to want to put in there so uh I think (10:23 - 10:26)
that&#39;s a nice (10:25 - 10:28)
little it definitely feels like that (10:26 - 10:31)
update was made for the crom matics (10:28 - 10:33)
feature exactly yeah that you can (10:31 - 10:38)
actually see you have 278 growth candy (10:33 - 10:41)
and just compare it to all of the others (10:38 - 10:42)
exactly because I was thinking when it (10:41 - 10:44)
came out I was like what is what good is (10:42 - 10:45)
I mean it&#39;s great to see what I have (10:44 - 10:47)
candy for but if you click on Candy you (10:45 - 10:49)
can&#39;t do anything with it it just tells (10:47 - 10:50)
you that it&#39;s (10:49 - 10:52)
candy now you&#39;re going to be able to do (10:50 - 10:54)
something with it this makes more sense (10:52 - 10:57)
yes uh this is limited though uh the (10:54 - 10:59)
cromatic will be gone when the event is (10:57 - 11:00)
over (10:59 - 11:02)
um and then I think although I&#39;m (11:00 - 11:05)
scanning this news article I think (11:02 - 11:07)
there&#39;s a limit yeah you can use it four (11:05 - 11:12)
times a day so just be kind of maybe you (11:07 - 11:13)
can use it four times a day and each (11:12 - 11:15)
time you use it it&#39;ll take more dream (11:13 - 11:18)
shards so you&#39;re going to want to use it (11:15 - 11:20)
over the course of the (11:18 - 11:23)
week rather than all in one or two days (11:20 - 11:25)
you&#39;re bet you would be better off doing (11:23 - 11:29)
it once a day for seven days instead of (11:25 - 11:31)
twice (11:29 - 11:35)
instead of four times a day for two days (11:31 - 11:38)
yes you would (11:35 - 11:40)
yeah (11:38 - 11:43)
so but again maybe maybe plan out what (11:40 - 11:46)
you&#39;re going to throw (11:43 - 11:49)
away and their example is like putting (11:46 - 11:51)
Bulbasaur don&#39;t their example is (11:49 - 11:52)
Bulbasaur candy don&#39;t just put the (11:51 - 11:55)
Bulbasaur candy into the bubbles you (11:52 - 11:59)
want to level that one up (11:55 - 11:59)
um there will be bonuses this event (12:01 - 12:05)
starts on June (12:03 - 12:08)
17th and runs a whole week uh dishes (12:05 - 12:11)
will be set to Curry and stew I don&#39;t (12:08 - 12:12)
know if we&#39;ve talked about this on the (12:11 - 12:14)
show I I know I keep saying I&#39;m working (12:12 - 12:17)
on a big Pokemon sleep video I I am I (12:14 - 12:19)
promise it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;ve recorded So Much (12:17 - 12:23)
footage I wrote like too many words it (12:19 - 12:25)
was like a 40 minute video I brought it (12:23 - 12:28)
down to 20 minutes there&#39;s a (12:25 - 12:31)
lot I um it&#39;s almost done I promise it (12:28 - 12:32)
probably would have been done if I (12:31 - 12:34)
wasn&#39;t in Japan for two weeks I did not (12:32 - 12:37)
say this in the video but I will say it (12:34 - 12:39)
here here&#39;s your tip when you know that (12:37 - 12:43)
the event for the we know that the event (12:39 - 12:45)
coming up will be Curry (12:43 - 12:49)
right so you can set aside certain (12:45 - 12:51)
ingredients so you can start off your (12:49 - 12:53)
weak strong so if you look at your Curry (12:51 - 12:56)
list and your like best meal is like (12:53 - 12:58)
mushrooms potatoes I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t (12:56 - 13:00)
know a cur ree off the top of my head (12:58 - 13:02)
like mushrooms potato (13:00 - 13:06)
corn um like you could just go this (13:02 - 13:08)
whole week or next week I guess well (13:06 - 13:10)
this week you could go this whole week (13:08 - 13:12)
and just like try to avoid using (13:10 - 13:14)
mushrooms or switch to a Pokemon to get (13:12 - 13:16)
you the ingredients that kind of set (13:14 - 13:18)
them aside and because there are no (13:16 - 13:20)
bonuses this week the week we&#39;re (13:18 - 13:23)
recording this you could just be like ah (13:20 - 13:26)
like it&#39;s going to be a bad week but (13:23 - 13:28)
that&#39;s okay because next week I&#39;m going (13:26 - 13:30)
to I&#39;m going to pop the good Camp ticket (13:28 - 13:33)
I&#39;m saving my mushrooms Karan is coming (13:30 - 13:34)
you can kind of like (13:33 - 13:36)
pregame (13:34 - 13:38)
your there&#39;s a lot of pregaming in (13:36 - 13:40)
Pokemon sleep a lot of pregaming and (13:38 - 13:42)
sleep this is you can plan and you can (13:40 - 13:44)
prepare for the week that&#39;s coming ahead (13:42 - 13:46)
especially if you know which island (13:44 - 13:47)
you&#39;re going to because then you will (13:46 - 13:51)
know the berries and the kind of meal (13:47 - 13:54)
that is going to be there for that week (13:51 - 13:56)
MH and that means you can prepare your (13:54 - 13:59)
entire team ahead of time yep which like (13:56 - 14:01)
if you knew it was going to be dessert (13:59 - 14:04)
you would want us to save like (14:01 - 14:06)
cacao cuz I actually don&#39;t even think (14:04 - 14:09)
there&#39;s any meals curries that use cacao (14:06 - 14:10)
at (14:09 - 14:13)
all I think there&#39;s one yeah I feel like (14:10 - 14:15)
there&#39;s one there&#39;s one or two but it&#39;s (14:13 - 14:17)
not not yeah not nearly as many as (14:15 - 14:21)
something like dessert yeah speaking of (14:17 - 14:25)
islands uh topal is off the (14:21 - 14:29)
list sad sad no great music this week or (14:25 - 14:32)
week I guess uh cr&#39;s going to be on (14:29 - 14:33)
three islands it&#39;s going to be on green (14:32 - 14:35)
grass cuz every Pokemon is on green (14:33 - 14:37)
grass uh it&#39;s going to be on Canan Beach (14:35 - 14:39)
and it&#39;s going to be on snow drop Tundra (14:37 - 14:41)
actually which is a little weird because (14:39 - 14:42)
I feel like karant fits a little bit (14:41 - 14:44)
better on lapis Lake Side than it does (14:42 - 14:45)
in (14:44 - 14:48)
Snowdrop but maybe the developers also (14:45 - 14:50)
realize that snow drop is just as (14:48 - 14:54)
useless as topalo like those to be fair (14:50 - 14:56)
those two islands do (14:54 - 15:00)
get like skipped the most like I think a (14:56 - 15:01)
lot of people just go straight to lapis (15:00 - 15:04)
because of Ralts and because of Stuffle (15:01 - 15:06)
and because of um Dratini like no other (15:04 - 15:09)
Islands have those yeah and those three (15:06 - 15:11)
Pokemon specifically do have a (15:09 - 15:14)
legitimate power creep compared (15:11 - 15:19)
to every other Pokemon before it (15:14 - 15:24)
so my suggestion is go to the (15:19 - 15:26)
island that one you have unlocked but (15:24 - 15:27)
also that (15:26 - 15:30)
your Island is it called the island like (15:27 - 15:32)
score Island boost or whatever is (15:30 - 15:34)
highest Island boost yeah that sounds (15:32 - 15:36)
great cuz it can go up to (15:34 - 15:39)
60% so most people should have probably (15:36 - 15:41)
Green Grass at 60% especially if you&#39;ve (15:39 - 15:44)
been playing for like two or three (15:41 - 15:48)
months not Bobby though not me not me no (15:44 - 15:50)
just I&#39;m only ever on green grass during (15:48 - 15:52)
those events during like the legend like (15:50 - 15:54)
I&#39;ve only been on green grass during (15:52 - 15:58)
ente and REO uh REO events so I think I (15:54 - 16:00)
would like it&#39;s seems like your best (15:58 - 16:02)
chance to get karant would be snow drop (16:00 - 16:04)
because the boosted Pokemon on snow drop (16:02 - 16:07)
are psychic or Psyduck Slowpoke slow bro (16:04 - 16:11)
Deli bird swablue crat and then on green (16:07 - 16:16)
grass literally every Pokemon Under the (16:11 - 16:16)
Sun (16:16 - 16:21)
but a lot of them all the ones that are (16:18 - 16:24)
the right types yeah yeah the ones that (16:21 - 16:27)
match bug flying and water uh but I (16:24 - 16:30)
think I&#39;m going to go to (16:27 - 16:33)
the beach because I have a excellent (16:30 - 16:35)
Blastoise so I know it&#39;s going to be (16:33 - 16:38)
oron Berry I have a wiggly tough I know (16:35 - 16:42)
that the little what Wiggly Peta Berry (16:38 - 16:45)
yeah I know that so I know like my two (16:42 - 16:46)
best Pokemon work on the (16:45 - 16:49)
beach (16:46 - 16:52)
um and then whatever else I need to like (16:49 - 16:56)
rearrange to focus on meals and I do (16:52 - 16:58)
think I also I need I need a berry (16:56 - 16:59)
finding Totodile so that&#39;s another (16:58 - 17:01)
reason I would go to beach in this in (16:59 - 17:04)
this situation when the not only will we (17:01 - 17:07)
know that it will be set to curry curry (17:04 - 17:10)
will be multiplied by (17:07 - 17:10)
1.5 so your meals will be (17:10 - 17:16)
more I I remember having a conversation (17:14 - 17:19)
with Bobby I think after we (17:16 - 17:23)
recorded um one of the podcast where we (17:19 - 17:26)
were talking about riko or not riko it (17:23 - 17:28)
was it was some event that was boosted I (17:26 - 17:30)
think it was like the Valentine&#39;s Day (17:28 - 17:31)
event or something I can&#39;t remember it (17:30 - 17:34)
was a it was a meal boosted event and I (17:31 - 17:35)
was like oh I didn&#39;t even focus on (17:34 - 17:38)
berries this week I just focused on (17:35 - 17:41)
ingredients MH and I think it&#39;s the same (17:38 - 17:45)
here too so because we know that it&#39;s (17:41 - 17:47)
going to be Curry it&#39;s going to be (17:45 - 17:49)
1.5 even though I don&#39;t have a berry (17:47 - 17:51)
finding Totodile you&#39;re just going to (17:49 - 17:53)
get so much more from (17:51 - 17:57)
cooking so focusing on which ingredients (17:53 - 17:59)
you want to make meals even if those (17:57 - 18:01)
Pokémon don&#39;t match up like I probably (17:59 - 18:02)
will bring Victory Bell because Victory (18:01 - 18:05)
Bell just brings so much tomato uh (18:02 - 18:08)
potato and I think potato goes into (18:05 - 18:10)
Curry I had have to look at the list but (18:08 - 18:12)
sounds about right yeah like not (18:10 - 18:15)
matching the berries but getting the (18:12 - 18:18)
actual ingredients you need to me always (18:15 - 18:19)
seems way more important during these (18:18 - 18:21)
kind of (18:19 - 18:23)
events I will say if you have a big (18:21 - 18:26)
enough bag for your ingredients if you (18:23 - 18:29)
can carry enough ingredients (18:26 - 18:31)
uh you can make it through a good chunk (18:29 - 18:34)
of the week even with a good camp ticket (18:31 - 18:37)
even making meals where your pot is (18:34 - 18:39)
leveled up and you can fit a ton of (18:37 - 18:41)
ingredients in there you can make it (18:39 - 18:43)
through a good chunk of the week with (18:41 - 18:46)
without any ingredient Gathering (18:43 - 18:49)
Pokemon oh just cuz just having saved up (18:46 - 18:50)
you mean like having saved up previously (18:49 - 18:53)
and then just allowing like the regular (18:50 - 18:56)
ingredients being found and nothing like (18:53 - 18:58)
super boosted or anything I mean you (18:56 - 19:01)
just don&#39;t need to find ingredients for (18:58 - 19:04)
probably half the week because you have (19:01 - 19:07)
500 ingredients to start with oh right (19:04 - 19:10)
right yeah 500 or about that pregaming (19:07 - 19:12)
it&#39;s all about that PR pre like I want (19:10 - 19:14)
my first three meals on Gathering the (19:12 - 19:16)
right berries and you can have all the (19:14 - 19:19)
ingredients for the right meals sure (19:16 - 19:20)
yeah I want my first three meals on (19:19 - 19:23)
Monday to be like the best meals I can (19:20 - 19:26)
make so my Monday night going into (19:23 - 19:31)
Tuesday isn&#39;t like B Sprout Pichu Bells (19:26 - 19:32)
Sprout (19:31 - 19:35)
ekins yeah no you got to start your week (19:32 - 19:37)
strong it&#39;s just like just like any (19:35 - 19:39)
Monday right you start that Monday (19:37 - 19:42)
strong and the rest of the week and work (19:39 - 19:44)
itself (19:42 - 19:47)
out it does say you will meet you may (19:44 - 19:49)
meet certain Shiny (19:47 - 19:51)
Pokemon but I feel like when there&#39;s a (19:49 - 19:54)
shiny boost it&#39;s it clearly it will (19:51 - 19:57)
state that the shiny boost is there so I (19:54 - 19:59)
don&#39;t know why the words you make meet (19:57 - 20:00)
certain Shiny (19:59 - 20:02)
Pokemon I think they&#39;ve used this (20:00 - 20:06)
wording before yes I feel like I&#39;ve only (20:02 - 20:08)
been a part of one event where there (20:06 - 20:11)
were boosted chiniese of which I didn&#39;t (20:08 - 20:14)
get any by the way but uh it it like (20:11 - 20:17)
clearly St zero out of 10 event uh no it (20:14 - 20:20)
clearly stated that they were going to (20:17 - 20:21)
be like that it was more likely that (20:20 - 20:25)
they would be shiny in the news update (20:21 - 20:26)
before you started playing there was a (20:25 - 20:28)
big event where it was like Absol is (20:26 - 20:30)
boosted and bulbas is like they listed (20:28 - 20:32)
like six Pokémon that were more likely (20:30 - 20:34)
to be shiny and they said that I&#39;m just (20:32 - 20:37)
saying in this situation they&#39;re saying (20:34 - 20:40)
you may meet certain Shiny Pokemon yeah (20:37 - 20:41)
it&#39;s weird that they saying it if it (20:40 - 20:44)
doesn&#39;t mean anything it yeah it&#39;s under (20:41 - 20:48)
bonuses so maybe I don&#39;t know maybe (20:44 - 20:51)
there&#39;s just a general shiny boost I I (20:48 - 20:54)
have I&#39;ve I&#39;ve played this game every (20:51 - 20:56)
day haven&#39;t missed a (20:54 - 20:59)
day I I I&#39;ve played since day one I have (20:56 - 21:03)
had eight shinies since day one and I (20:59 - 21:06)
saw somebody on threads say that they&#39;re (21:03 - 21:08)
like I just got my 40th (21:06 - 21:12)
shiny Jesus well I&#39;m got to say I&#39;m (21:08 - 21:13)
surprised that you only have eight (21:12 - 21:15)
shinies because I&#39;ve only been playing (21:13 - 21:18)
for what 10 weeks maybe like two and a (21:15 - 21:21)
half months and I have five shinies uh (21:18 - 21:23)
like not that far behind you you&#39;ve been (21:21 - 21:26)
playing for a lot longer than I have but (21:23 - 21:28)
it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s RNG right yeah it&#39;s all (21:26 - 21:30)
RNG yeah Hannah&#39;s Hannah&#39;s about to (21:28 - 21:33)
reveal she has like 30 shinies I don&#39;t (21:30 - 21:35)
have 30 but I think I have more than (21:33 - 21:37)
either of you I&#39;m just waiting for the (21:35 - 21:39)
game to load cuz it&#39;s stuck on that now (21:37 - 21:42)
loading screen they&#39;re all shiny (21:39 - 21:46)
Riolu right CU she doesn&#39;t leave Topo so (21:42 - 21:48)
they&#39;re nothing but Riolu I only have (21:46 - 21:51)
one shiny (21:48 - 21:54)
Riolu two my shinies are Atkins what am (21:51 - 22:00)
I going to do with that yeah I have uh (21:54 - 22:05)
um 1 2 3 48 12 (22:00 - 22:10)
oh 14 shinies jeez two of them are (22:05 - 22:12)
Jigglypuff are any of them good (22:10 - 22:15)
jigglypuffs though they&#39;re almost almost (22:12 - 22:16)
good (22:15 - 22:18)
jigglypuffs which is why I haven&#39;t used (22:16 - 22:20)
them would they be almost good if they (22:18 - 22:23)
weren&#39;t shiny no they&#39;d probably be (22:20 - 22:25)
like&#39; be right to the trash can if they (22:23 - 22:29)
weren&#39;t they don&#39;t have the right (22:25 - 22:33)
that kind of thing yeah bad nature can (22:29 - 22:35)
ruin a whole Pokemon in this game oh (22:33 - 22:38)
yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah totally (22:35 - 22:40)
neutral nature is actually like kind of (22:38 - 22:42)
okay in this game like I would take a (22:40 - 22:45)
neutral over I yeah when I see that I&#39;m (22:42 - 22:49)
like yes like I&#39;ll take (22:45 - 22:49)
it uh we do not know what karant will do (22:49 - 22:56)
um in the game they are listing it as a (22:53 - 22:58)
flying type Pokemon which is like really (22:56 - 22:59)
interesting (22:58 - 23:02)
cuz I don&#39;t know karant always screams (22:59 - 23:04)
water to me but this game is really (23:02 - 23:07)
lacking on flying types currently not (23:04 - 23:09)
that there aren&#39;t like 500 flying type (23:07 - 23:11)
Pokemon in the actual like series that (23:09 - 23:13)
they could easily introduce but they&#39;re (23:11 - 23:16)
like let&#39;s take the water bird and make (23:13 - 23:20)
it flying is a bird it flying to me (23:16 - 23:23)
because it has wings and flies yeah but (23:20 - 23:24)
it&#39;s always swimming its whole thing is (23:23 - 23:26)
diving under the water and catching the (23:24 - 23:29)
fish but it&#39;s a bird have you ever seen (23:26 - 23:31)
a corant dive under the (23:29 - 23:35)
water that the bird it&#39;s based on they (23:31 - 23:37)
swim they actually swim that&#39;s fine (23:35 - 23:39)
that&#39;s totally understandable I&#39;m just (23:37 - 23:41)
saying like if something screams if (23:39 - 23:43)
something is water and another type and (23:41 - 23:45)
it&#39;s going to scream something at me a (23:43 - 23:49)
bird is gonna scream flying at me uh (23:45 - 23:52)
that that&#39;s true I do think isn&#39;t (23:49 - 23:56)
crat water no it&#39;s flying (23:52 - 23:59)
water um which I think (23:56 - 24:02)
lot of birds are the flying is the (23:59 - 24:04)
secondary type like I think it&#39;s like (24:02 - 24:06)
normal flying because there&#39;s never been (24:04 - 24:10)
like an only flying like um so like in (24:06 - 24:12)
Pokemon go the background of a Pokemon (24:10 - 24:15)
is based on its uh primary type based on (24:12 - 24:17)
its first type and there are so few that (24:15 - 24:19)
have the flying background the first one (24:17 - 24:22)
was Tornadus because it was flying only (24:19 - 24:24)
but there is other flying Pokemon I (24:22 - 24:26)
think I think there&#39;s no other primary (24:24 - 24:29)
flying Pokemon before Tornadus (24:26 - 24:32)
in Pokemon yes tornados is the it&#39;s (24:29 - 24:34)
tornados and then Tornadus and rooked (24:32 - 24:37)
corvisquire are the only pure flying (24:34 - 24:43)
Pokemon and then nobat corvite karant (24:37 - 24:45)
bombarder and (24:43 - 24:49)
flamigo are flying first then their (24:45 - 24:52)
secondary type and then every other (24:49 - 24:56)
flying Pokemon which is a lot of (24:52 - 24:59)
them flying is always (24:56 - 25:01)
secondary so that would be like your (24:59 - 25:06)
pidgeys Skarmory Lugia hoo swablu (25:01 - 25:10)
Starly are there any Pokemon in sleep (25:06 - 25:13)
where they aren&#39;t their primary type so (25:10 - 25:15)
when they&#39;ve become just one type they (25:13 - 25:18)
aren&#39;t their primary CU I&#39;m pretty sure (25:15 - 25:20)
that&#39;s how they that just seems how they (25:18 - 25:24)
base it is it&#39;s would be wait yes is (25:20 - 25:26)
alaria flying dragon or is it drag (25:24 - 25:30)
alaria turns dragon alar oh okay so swwa (25:26 - 25:34)
is normal flying but it is flying in the (25:30 - 25:38)
game so it&#39;s first type would be normal (25:34 - 25:40)
and then when it evolves it&#39;s one of the (25:38 - 25:42)
Altaria line is one of the few Pokemon (25:40 - 25:44)
in Pokemon sleep where when it evolves (25:42 - 25:46)
it changes type completely and it (25:44 - 25:49)
changes to dragon there is no dragon (25:46 - 25:51)
island so if you have a good swablue (25:49 - 25:55)
maybe don&#39;t evolve it until the Dragon (25:51 - 25:57)
Island gets introduced you got that (25:55 - 25:59)
experience there don&#39;t (25:57 - 26:01)
sure (25:59 - 26:06)
do I sure do have that (26:01 - 26:06)
experience okay well then well swabl (26:07 - 26:11)
right there does it then because sbl&#39;s (26:09 - 26:12)
secondary type is flying and it&#39;s flying (26:11 - 26:15)
in sleep I want to say when they (26:12 - 26:17)
introduced den in Pokemon (26:15 - 26:21)
sleep they made a big deal about how Den (26:17 - 26:24)
was going to have a new (26:21 - 26:27)
ability um maybe I&#39;m wrong on that did (26:24 - 26:29)
they yes they (26:27 - 26:31)
they did that yeah in the I have the (26:29 - 26:34)
announcement here it was uh February (26:31 - 26:36)
28th uh it seems that Den will be (26:34 - 26:38)
spotted on Green Grass and near lapis (26:36 - 26:42)
like side Den&#39;s M oh no this is this is (26:38 - 26:44)
announcing that Den&#39;s main skill is a (26:42 - 26:45)
new main (26:44 - 26:47)
skill I&#39;m pretty sure they that they (26:45 - 26:49)
said though Den was getting a main skill (26:47 - 26:51)
and people were speculating what it (26:49 - 26:52)
would (26:51 - 26:55)
do I maybe I&#39;m misremembering but I feel (26:52 - 26:57)
like if karant was going to have (26:55 - 26:59)
something like brand new they would like (26:57 - 27:00)
hype it (26:59 - 27:04)
up so I don&#39;t know what karant like to (27:00 - 27:07)
me if I was to guess what crar would (27:04 - 27:10)
have I think increasing the cooking pot (27:07 - 27:12)
size would make (27:10 - 27:14)
sense like we have so many ingredient (27:12 - 27:17)
finders and I don&#39;t karant does not seem (27:14 - 27:20)
like a Pokemon that would regen energy (27:17 - 27:23)
to other things no (27:20 - 27:26)
not no I would almost guess ingredient (27:23 - 27:28)
finder but we do have a lot of those we (27:26 - 27:30)
don&#39;t have a lot of the ones that (27:28 - 27:32)
increase your pot (27:30 - 27:35)
size just like two that incre increase (27:32 - 27:38)
your pot size right magnite (27:35 - 27:42)
glacon glacon magnone and Flareon I (27:38 - 27:46)
think are the only three MH yeah like (27:42 - 27:49)
like Ninetales and Vulpix healing people (27:46 - 27:51)
like to me makes (27:49 - 27:53)
sense like Victory Bell healing itself (27:51 - 27:56)
like makes sense cuz like plants can (27:53 - 27:59)
photos I&#39;m like trying to justif I&#39;m (27:56 - 28:00)
really doing mental gy PL are not (27:59 - 28:04)
regenerative you like I just don&#39;t see (28:00 - 28:06)
like like ah no Victory Bell gets like (28:04 - 28:07)
ingrain it gets like gig drain it gets (28:06 - 28:09)
like a lot of things that can heal it oh (28:07 - 28:11)
okay yeah (28:09 - 28:14)
yeah like I just don&#39;t see how Kar would (28:11 - 28:15)
like heal somebody (28:14 - 28:17)
else so what are your options then your (28:15 - 28:19)
options are like critical hit chance (28:17 - 28:21)
which only Den (28:19 - 28:24)
has you have ingredient finder which (28:21 - 28:25)
like a lot of Pokemon get ingredient (28:24 - 28:27)
finder there are a lot of ingredient (28:25 - 28:31)
finders and then you have have um pot (28:27 - 28:35)
size and then everything else is like (28:31 - 28:35)
healing or the one that&#39;s just a boost (28:35 - 28:41)
the Boost like the the (28:38 - 28:44)
yeah the Boost the what is it the the (28:41 - 28:45)
Snorlax (28:44 - 28:49)
boost oh the charge strength Char yeah I (28:45 - 28:50)
don&#39;t like charge strength Pokemons I&#39;m (28:49 - 28:53)
not like a huge fan of really charge (28:50 - 28:55)
strength okay here we go I got charge (28:53 - 28:58)
strength small charge strength medium (28:55 - 29:01)
dream magnet if they make crar a dream (28:58 - 29:03)
magnet I will probably (29:01 - 29:05)
cry going to do it but I will also (29:03 - 29:08)
invest everything I have into (29:05 - 29:11)
crant at the same time so charge (29:08 - 29:13)
strength Smalls charge strength medium (29:11 - 29:17)
dream magnet energizing cheer which is (29:13 - 29:21)
just Sylveon Wigglytuff cavor that&#39;s (29:17 - 29:24)
everyone right that gives it toor uh (29:21 - 29:27)
energizing cheer everyone yes energizing (29:24 - 29:31)
cheer is just just like um Vulpix (29:27 - 29:34)
Ninetails charge strength small which is (29:31 - 29:37)
like charge strength the other charge (29:34 - 29:40)
strength except it&#39;s (29:37 - 29:42)
randomized dream magnet again which is (29:40 - 29:44)
random because there&#39;s dream magnet that (29:42 - 29:46)
is just obtain 88 dream shards but then (29:44 - 29:49)
there&#39;s dream magnet dream Shard magnet (29:46 - 29:52)
whatever which is 44 to (29:49 - 29:55)
176 the these are really bad names for (29:52 - 29:59)
the record there&#39;s extra helpful (29:55 - 30:01)
which I feel like karan&#39;s too dumb of a (29:59 - 30:04)
Pokemon to be extra helpful it just (30:01 - 30:07)
doesn&#39;t make sense like thematically (30:04 - 30:10)
there&#39;s nothing helpful about (30:07 - 30:14)
crar there&#39;s ingredient magnet there&#39;s (30:10 - 30:18)
cooking power which only Den has uh (30:14 - 30:19)
which also would be good I feel like (30:18 - 30:23)
cooking power to uh or or sorry not (30:19 - 30:26)
cooking power sorry cooking power is (30:23 - 30:31)
what is glacon yeah magnone Flareon (30:26 - 30:33)
metronome which obviously doesn&#39;t make (30:31 - 30:36)
any sense tasty chance that&#39;s only den (30:33 - 30:38)
and then helper boost which is helper (30:36 - 30:42)
boost is raicho ente (30:38 - 30:45)
Arcanine so I have a question about (30:42 - 30:48)
tasty because I don&#39;t have a den uh no (30:45 - 30:52)
matter how hard I try no den um how so I (30:48 - 30:56)
know with like the ingredient or the the (30:52 - 30:58)
pot where you can make the pot big for (30:56 - 31:01)
your next meal if you trigger that (30:58 - 31:03)
multiple times before your next meal it (31:01 - 31:06)
just adds on right so like if my Flareon (31:03 - 31:08)
triggers three times before lunch it (31:06 - 31:10)
will be minus level one so instead of (31:08 - 31:12)
seven ingredients it will be 21 (31:10 - 31:14)
ingredients added because it&#39;s each time (31:12 - 31:17)
does that do anything with Den denes (31:14 - 31:18)
like with the critical does it make it (31:17 - 31:20)
like more likely to be critical every (31:18 - 31:23)
time it triggers it builds up until you (31:20 - 31:27)
get a extra tasty meal oh wow really (31:23 - 31:30)
it&#39;s so good until the weekend so (31:27 - 31:33)
good what make sure you have a master (31:30 - 31:37)
biscuit for when you see a for Den makes (31:33 - 31:39)
I always switch it to D on (31:37 - 31:42)
Sunday because you already get (31:39 - 31:42)
20% and then de Den can go all day so it (31:43 - 31:47)
just makes (31:46 - 31:50)
the because I I I&#39;ll let like I ran (31:47 - 31:52)
magnone all week right because I wanted (31:50 - 31:54)
a bigger pot and same thing same thing (31:52 - 31:56)
Bobby I would hit I would hit like main (31:54 - 31:58)
skill like twice before a meal so I&#39;m (31:56 - 32:01)
I&#39;m adding like 14 extra ingredients (31:58 - 32:02)
every (32:01 - 32:04)
meal um and I didn&#39;t run a good camp (32:02 - 32:06)
ticket so my pot size was like a little (32:04 - 32:09)
bit smaller than I&#39;d like but then (32:06 - 32:10)
there&#39;s no point in running Magna Zone (32:09 - 32:12)
on Sunday because your pot&#39;s already (32:10 - 32:14)
like huge on (32:12 - 32:16)
Sunday right and so I just switched (32:14 - 32:18)
magnone out for (32:16 - 32:21)
den and then just like like I my first (32:18 - 32:22)
meal of the day was crit because it was (32:21 - 32:25)
a instead of a 20% chance it was a 24% (32:22 - 32:27)
chance well my first meal of the day (32:25 - 32:29)
today was also so crit even though I (32:27 - 32:32)
don&#39;t have a that was cool who slow (32:29 - 32:35)
down there is a higher chance on (32:32 - 32:39)
Sundays yeah right um that&#39;s oh when are (32:35 - 32:41)
they going introduce trading to Pokemon (32:39 - 32:44)
sleep so I can get a den from someone (32:41 - 32:45)
because there&#39;s like no way for me to (32:44 - 32:48)
get one look I&#39;ve been on lapis all week (32:45 - 32:51)
not a single raltz not a single Dratini (32:48 - 32:52)
not a single Stuffle not a single (32:51 - 32:55)
Dratini or not Dratini (32:52 - 32:58)
Den what am I even doing on lapis I woke (32:55 - 33:00)
up this morning to three Squirtles and (32:58 - 33:03)
two War Turtles I&#39;m master rank (33:00 - 33:05)
three if I wanted that I would have went (33:03 - 33:09)
to Canan Beach well you are gonna go to (33:05 - 33:12)
Canan Beach so you&#39;re right get ready I (33:09 - 33:14)
can&#39;t wait for two weeks of no to den (33:12 - 33:18)
because I&#39;m GNA be on beach for two (33:14 - 33:21)
weeks I&#39;m Master balling karant unless (33:18 - 33:23)
unless unless they announced that (33:21 - 33:25)
there&#39;s a crar incense coming for one of (33:23 - 33:28)
the missions so yeah but I&#39;m almost crar (33:25 - 33:31)
will be the same difficulty to catch as (33:28 - 33:35)
Den or kcan or Pinsir oh are they are (33:31 - 33:39)
they which means if you a lot yeah so (33:35 - 33:43)
Den is if you have the premium biscuit (33:39 - 33:46)
which is four four time 3 is 12 but I (33:43 - 33:48)
think you need (33:46 - 33:52)
16 to catch Den so you need to you need (33:48 - 33:55)
to have it be hungry hit your premium (33:52 - 33:58)
have a great ball and then have a poke (33:55 - 34:00)
ball and you got to Hope after you give (33:58 - 34:03)
it the great ball it&#39;s not going to be (34:00 - 34:06)
full yeah that is that&#39;s what happened (34:03 - 34:07)
that is what happened with my pincer (34:06 - 34:09)
they just happened to be hungry and so (34:07 - 34:11)
and then I was able to get it all with (34:09 - 34:14)
the premium biscuit great ball poke ball (34:11 - 34:17)
ball yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s real rough I&#39;m (34:14 - 34:19)
sure eventually they&#39;ll introduce a like (34:17 - 34:21)
an Ultra Ball it would just make sense (34:19 - 34:23)
later down in the line it&#39;s real rough (34:21 - 34:25)
both of you say while on the premium (34:23 - 34:26)
while having access to the premium (34:25 - 34:29)
biscuit and the Great Balls (34:26 - 34:32)

confusion when I first started listening (37:06 - 37:12)
like dealing with sleep but I totally (37:09 - 37:14)
understand it now I don&#39;t think karant (37:12 - 37:17)

is to (37:17 - 37:19)
me all right uh let&#39;s take a break and (37:22 - 37:29)
then when we come back we got some FBI (37:26 - 37:33)
news so we will be right (37:29 - 37:38)
back and we are back from our break (37:33 - 37:43)
um this is off Pokey Beach (37:38 - 37:43)
FBI didn&#39;t think this podcast would get (37:45 - 37:51)
any more weird uh F this is actually (37:48 - 37:53)
this was uh last month but we didn&#39;t (37:51 - 37:56)
cover it FBI arrests two men for forging (37:53 - 38:00)
$2 million of PSA graded Pokemon and (37:56 - 38:03)
sports (38:00 - 38:03)
cards uh the the FBI has announced (38:06 - 38:13)
charges against two Washington men (38:11 - 38:16)
accused of forging PSA graded Pokemon (38:13 - 38:19)
and sports card sports cards resulting (38:16 - 38:22)
in over $2 million in losses for victims (38:19 - 38:25)
across the United States the pair of men (38:22 - 38:27)
have been charged with wire fraud and (38:25 - 38:30)
conspir iracy to commit wire fraud if (38:27 - 38:33)
convicted both men will carry a maximum (38:30 - 38:35)
sentence of 20 years in (38:33 - 38:38)
prison (38:35 - 38:42)
um they altered PSA label I&#39;m not going (38:38 - 38:43)
to read their names you can read the (38:42 - 38:44)
article on Pokey Beach it&#39;ll be linked (38:43 - 38:48)
in the the show notes um they altered (38:44 - 38:51)
and forged PSA labels to make the cards (38:48 - 38:54)
appear to have higher grades the pair (38:51 - 38:56)
used fake identities to sell slabs at (38:54 - 38:58)
card shops auctions card shows online (38:56 - 39:00)
markting places even the pair were (38:58 - 39:02)
informed their slabs were faked they (39:00 - 39:06)
continued to sell them uh the undercover (39:02 - 39:07)
law enforce I love how there was (39:06 - 39:13)
undercover police to buy a fake PSA 10 (39:07 - 39:17)
Venusaur from one of the men for (39:13 - 39:17)
$10,000 uh one once the officer wired (39:17 - 39:22)
the money to the bank account the card (39:20 - 39:24)
was shipped out the transaction (39:22 - 39:27)
constituted as wire fraud or knowing (39:24 - 39:30)
knowingly defrauding a victim of (39:27 - 39:34)
money uh the article goes on and also (39:30 - 39:36)
it&#39;s very funny that poke Beach says (39:34 - 39:37)
recently GameStop has announced that (39:36 - 39:39)
they will buy PSA graded cards it a (39:37 - 39:42)
weird like way to end the article you (39:39 - 39:44)
got to get that you got to get that link (39:42 - 39:46)
at the (39:44 - 39:46)
end I looked a little bit more into this (39:46 - 39:52)
and uh this is not the first time I (39:49 - 39:54)
think I I I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s both men (39:52 - 39:58)
but one of the the dudes here had like (39:54 - 40:01)
already a history of fraud before this (39:58 - 40:04)
in like another market and he just (40:01 - 40:06)
switched over to Pokemon and sports (40:04 - 40:08)
cards as his new fraud if you have the (40:06 - 40:12)
expertise take take it across Industries (40:08 - 40:15)
I guess when all you know is scamming (40:12 - 40:19)
people you just adjust the (40:15 - 40:19)
scam I I don&#39;t know what you can do with (40:20 - 40:26)
this information besides like the FBI (40:22 - 40:29)
was investigating (40:26 - 40:31)
well the thing that&#39;s weird to me and I (40:29 - 40:34)
guess it has to do with whether people (40:31 - 40:36)
how in-depth people get with purchasing (40:34 - 40:39)
so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t buy slabs I don&#39;t (40:36 - 40:42)
like to get the the graded cards like I (40:39 - 40:44)
just I&#39;d rather have them in a binder or (40:42 - 40:46)
in like a different glass like uh (40:44 - 40:48)
protective case if I want but I don&#39;t (40:46 - 40:51)
really it&#39;s expensive for one to get (40:48 - 40:53)
them graded and unless you&#39;re planning (40:51 - 40:55)
to I feel like unless you&#39;re planning to (40:53 - 40:57)
resell them or if you just specifically (40:55 - 41:00)
like collecting specific grades um then (40:57 - 41:01)
I&#39;d rather just keep it in like a (41:00 - 41:04)
different case or whatever but you can (41:01 - 41:08)
like look up the like every label has a (41:04 - 41:12)
specific number that is for that grade (41:08 - 41:15)
and I believe you can look up on psa&#39;s (41:12 - 41:18)
website and verify like you can put that (41:15 - 41:20)
number in and it should (41:18 - 41:24)
verify that grade and so you would think (41:20 - 41:27)
when people are buying these graded um (41:24 - 41:30)
these graded uh cards that they would be (41:27 - 41:33)
you know verifying that against it in (41:30 - 41:35)
some way butter I guess if you&#39;re I (41:33 - 41:36)
guess if you&#39;re just buying them at a (41:35 - 41:39)
shop or something or at a show you you (41:36 - 41:42)
kind of assume you kind of assume when (41:39 - 41:45)
it&#39;s in the PSA labeled um case and (41:42 - 41:49)
everything Counterpoint people are lazy (41:45 - 41:53)
yeah and how I don&#39;t you no disagreement (41:49 - 41:55)
with you Bobby there&#39;s I bought I bought (41:53 - 41:58)
a PSA card in Japan I don&#39;t buy PS SAA (41:55 - 42:00)
cards at all I (41:58 - 42:04)
own three I think and one of them was (42:00 - 42:06)
gifted to me and the other one was just (42:04 - 42:09)
a karant I bought off eBay for like $20 (42:06 - 42:12)
it was like a PSA 9 karant I was like (42:09 - 42:15)
free shipping 20 bucks (42:12 - 42:18)
cool so I own like three PSA cards I&#39;m (42:15 - 42:21)
with you Bobby (42:18 - 42:23)
I I&#39;m not super into like collecting (42:21 - 42:27)
slabs I they take up a lot of space like (42:23 - 42:29)
binder is much easier to put everything (42:27 - 42:32)
in zip it up fold it away I know where (42:29 - 42:35)
they all are I&#39;m I I have no clue right (42:32 - 42:36)
now where those other two slabs are the (42:35 - 42:37)
only reason I know where the current (42:36 - 42:39)
slab is I bought is because I haven&#39;t (42:37 - 42:42)
unpacked my luggage it&#39;s still in my (42:39 - 42:46)
luggage but I was like I was you know (42:42 - 42:49)
you&#39;re you&#39;re in a different country the (42:46 - 42:51)
dollar is really strong compared to the (42:49 - 42:53)
Yen so what when I saw it I was like oh (42:51 - 42:55)
man I do really like this card it was a (42:53 - 42:56)
Japanese exclusive card it was the (42:55 - 42:58)
Galler friend card (42:56 - 43:00)
it was like all the Galler people (42:58 - 43:04)
Japanese exclusive it was PSA 10 uh I (43:00 - 43:06)
looked up the price on eBay and it was (43:04 - 43:08)
already $30 (43:06 - 43:11)
cheaper in person than it was on eBay (43:08 - 43:13)
and I was like and and the dollar was (43:11 - 43:14)
already really strong and I was like you (43:13 - 43:17)
know what not huge into PSA I think this (43:14 - 43:19)
is a cool like souvenir because I like (43:17 - 43:21)
it was like the first card shop I found (43:19 - 43:22)
in Sendai which was actually right (43:21 - 43:24)
across the hallway from the Pokemon (43:22 - 43:27)
Center in Sendai and so I bought it (43:24 - 43:30)
was a PSA 10 yeah did you look up the (43:27 - 43:32)
number yeah that&#39;s the thing at no point (43:30 - 43:36)
did I ever consider looking up the (43:32 - 43:39)
number like the thing I did look up was (43:36 - 43:41)
what is market price on this card (43:39 - 43:42)
because I don&#39;t know so I went to like (43:41 - 43:44)
eBay to like see recently sold auctions (43:42 - 43:46)
and stuff (43:44 - 43:49)
but I would I would probably argue a lot (43:46 - 43:51)
of people don&#39;t even consider looking up (43:49 - 43:53)
the number I do think it&#39;s impressive I (43:51 - 43:55)
don&#39;t know how they did it right like (43:53 - 43:58)
they had to get their own slabs or break (43:55 - 44:01)
open slabs or just Photoshop new labels (43:58 - 44:03)
and (44:01 - 44:06)
then yeah there they did mention (44:03 - 44:07)
something in the article a little bit (44:06 - 44:10)
about it but yeah I mean when it comes (44:07 - 44:12)
to if they&#39;re trying to if they had to (44:10 - 44:15)
break open the slabs which I I mean (44:12 - 44:17)
people do it they crack them open I do (44:15 - 44:20)
not recommend it unless you absolutely (44:17 - 44:22)
know what you&#39;re doing cuz good chance (44:20 - 44:25)
you will ruin the card doing that are (44:22 - 44:27)
the labels on the inside of the slabs (44:25 - 44:30)
yeah yes good okay yep yeah they&#39;re on (44:27 - 44:32)
the inside so you would have to I don&#39;t (44:30 - 44:33)
know you&#39;d have to crack that open you&#39;d (44:32 - 44:37)
have to also have another case to that (44:33 - 44:38)
would mimic it and then make your own (44:37 - 44:43)
label there somehow but I guess so I (44:38 - 44:45)
assume that however much you spent on (44:43 - 44:48)
yours was not $10,000 like this no it (44:45 - 44:51)
was like it was literally like 60 bucks (44:48 - 44:53)
yeah yeah so yeah for the record it&#39;s (44:51 - 44:54)
not like I&#39;m it&#39;s not like this was a (44:53 - 44:57)
very expensive card it was like on eBay (44:54 - 45:00)
it was like 100 bucks maybe 120 I was (44:57 - 45:03)
like it&#39;s expensive that&#39;s that&#39;s (45:00 - 45:05)
expensive if you think like what a pack (45:03 - 45:07)
of Pokemon cards costs and then you know (45:05 - 45:09)
what the other cards are individually (45:07 - 45:11)
worth but I&#39;m just thinking when you get (45:09 - 45:14)
up into the multiple thousands of (45:11 - 45:16)
dollars and they said they defra it by (45:14 - 45:18)
like $2 million so I feel like there has (45:16 - 45:20)
to be some cards in there that were (45:18 - 45:23)
worth I mean that person that undercover (45:20 - 45:26)
cop bought a $10,000 Venusaur off of the (45:23 - 45:31)
person so so again lazy whatever you&#39;re (45:26 - 45:32)
just not thinking about it you don&#39;t (45:31 - 45:33)
think because like it&#39;s already in the (45:32 - 45:35)
PSA slab that there is that&#39;s the (45:33 - 45:37)
certification in itself but when you&#39;re (45:35 - 45:39)
buying (45:37 - 45:42)
$10,000 cards $50,000 cards things like (45:39 - 45:45)
that I feel like people would certify (45:42 - 45:47)
them in another way or like maybe double (45:45 - 45:50)
check but I mean I know people who will (45:47 - 45:53)
Who when they&#39;re buying very expensive (45:50 - 45:55)
ones or will fly to the location or (45:53 - 45:57)
they&#39;ll have them fly out there to (45:55 - 45:59)
actually pick the card up in person and (45:57 - 46:01)
things like that rather than um you like (45:59 - 46:03)
ship it right because I don&#39;t want to (46:01 - 46:05)
ship these really expensive cards and I (46:03 - 46:07)
feel like if you&#39;re willing to get on a (46:05 - 46:09)
plane and fly to a location to buy the (46:07 - 46:12)
card you would hopefully also be (46:09 - 46:14)
double-checking that certification (46:12 - 46:16)
according to the website of the (46:14 - 46:18)
Department of Justice it looks like they (46:16 - 46:21)
did get new card cases to put them in so (46:18 - 46:23)
that sounds like they did crack open (46:21 - 46:26)
slabs or just put Cards into slabs on (46:23 - 46:27)
their own (46:26 - 46:29)
right and then just create the then just (46:27 - 46:32)
create the fake label yeah (46:29 - 46:37)
yeah uh also keep in mind there&#39;s a huge (46:32 - 46:39)
price difference almost always between a (46:37 - 46:43)
PSA 9 and a PSA 10 yes so (46:39 - 46:46)
like I would I would guess that every (46:43 - 46:50)
single card they they sold for this $2 (46:46 - 46:52)
million were PSA 10s because just the (46:50 - 46:54)
price just (46:52 - 46:58)
skyrockets um yeah a a huge difference I (46:54 - 47:00)
mean like if you want to take the (46:58 - 47:01)
extreme you have that first edition (47:00 - 47:04)
Charizard that was the most sought after (47:01 - 47:06)
one of the most sought after cards a PSA (47:04 - 47:08)
10 of that card at its height was like (47:06 - 47:13)
$300,000 a PSA 9 was 30,000 so I mean it (47:08 - 47:16)
literally dropped that much just going (47:13 - 47:18)
from a 10 to a nine so I mean those (47:16 - 47:21)
numbers are can be hugely different (47:18 - 47:24)
between um a nine and a (47:21 - 47:27)
10 and that&#39;s why I always hated like (47:24 - 47:29)
YouTuber break boxes because when when (47:27 - 47:31)
you buy into a break box they just they (47:29 - 47:34)
just assume or like they they present it (47:31 - 47:37)
as a way of like oh if this was a 10 (47:34 - 47:39)
this is how much it&#39;s (47:37 - 47:44)
worth and it&#39;s so hard to already get a (47:39 - 47:46)
10 but that&#39;s why people crack open (47:44 - 47:50)
packs or crack open the the PSA shell (47:46 - 47:51)
because they&#39;ll send it some they&#39;ll (47:50 - 47:53)
send it it&#39;ll it&#39;ll they&#39;ll come back as (47:51 - 47:56)
a nine and they&#39;ll crack it open they&#39;ll (47:53 - 47:57)
send it again (47:56 - 48:01)
mhm and they&#39;ll do that until eventually (47:57 - 48:04)
somebody gives them a 10 because at (48:01 - 48:05)
there are guidelines I before the (48:04 - 48:07)
YouTube there the same people every time (48:05 - 48:09)
we bring this up they&#39;re like they (48:07 - 48:11)
guidelines they have to there&#39;s still a (48:09 - 48:15)
actual person that has to finalize a (48:11 - 48:17)
score and again to all those people that (48:15 - 48:18)
are like well they got to follow the (48:17 - 48:20)
guidelines there&#39;s tons of Tik toks (48:18 - 48:22)
there&#39;s tons of Instagram videos there&#39;s (48:20 - 48:24)
tons of just YouTube videos of people (48:22 - 48:26)
being like took it took five times but (48:24 - 48:29)
eventually they gave me a 10 right like (48:26 - 48:31)
they&#39;ll they&#39;ll keep sending it in yeah (48:29 - 48:33)
that happen that does happen all the (48:31 - 48:34)
time and even though there are (48:33 - 48:37)
guidelines it&#39;s still a human making the (48:34 - 48:38)
decision and there may be there&#39;s going (48:37 - 48:40)
to be some there could be some (48:38 - 48:42)
difference there in how they&#39;re you know (48:40 - 48:45)
deciding but I will say like going to (48:42 - 48:47)
card shows and things to buy stuff as (48:45 - 48:49)
well especially when you buy cards that (48:47 - 48:51)
are not graded just like watch out on (48:49 - 48:53)
pricing cuz sometimes people will also (48:51 - 48:55)
be like they&#39;ll price it on well I (48:53 - 48:57)
looked this up and a PSA 10 was this (48:55 - 48:59)
much so I&#39;m selling this card for this (48:57 - 49:01)
much even though even though it&#39;s not (48:59 - 49:03)
graded not selling a PSA 10 card you (49:01 - 49:06)
know so um just watch out for that when (49:03 - 49:07)
you&#39;re when you&#39;re at card shows and (49:06 - 49:08)
things not not that they&#39;re not even (49:07 - 49:10)
that they&#39;re doing it maliciously just (49:08 - 49:12)
that they&#39;re not maybe they&#39;re not as (49:10 - 49:14)
experienced and they&#39;re like looking up (49:12 - 49:17)
their own prices to sell their cards um (49:14 - 49:18)
and this is usually when people are like (49:17 - 49:19)
selling their own Collections and things (49:18 - 49:22)
like that more so than people who whose (49:19 - 49:25)
career is you know selling cards but uh (49:22 - 49:27)
I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been at shows literally where (49:25 - 49:29)
where people are selling cards and (49:27 - 49:31)
they&#39;re like well the PSA 10 is this (49:29 - 49:33)
much and this is how much I&#39;m selling it (49:31 - 49:35)
for you can&#39;t sell a card that the PSA (49:33 - 49:37)
10 number when it&#39;s not actually graded (49:35 - 49:40)
a PSA (49:37 - 49:43)
10 yeah that doesn&#39;t Ian you can if you (49:40 - 49:46)
want but don&#39;t do (49:43 - 49:51)

money uh (49:51 - 49:57)

different poster set though the (52:29 - 52:33)

slightly different but they&#39;re very (52:33 - 52:37)
similar to the ones I have here yeah yes (52:34 - 52:41)
they&#39;re they&#39;re similar now more now you (52:37 - 52:42)

Center UK right now you can go to (52:42 - 52:48)
Pokemon Center and you can actually look (52:45 - 52:52)
up that poster that is behind Hannah and (52:48 - 52:57)
you can see the price vile plume (52:52 - 52:59)
yeah uh and I remember what the price (52:57 - 53:04)
was because it was the same price as the (52:59 - 53:06)
one in Washington DC which you bought in (53:04 - 53:07)
person which you could only buy in (53:06 - 53:08)
person and it was about (53:07 - 53:11)
$20 I think specifically on Pokemon (53:08 - 53:12)
Center it was (53:11 - 53:15)
$18 now there are three new posters one (53:12 - 53:17)
of them having karant because it&#39;s a (53:15 - 53:20)
it&#39;s the like water Pokemon or (53:17 - 53:23)
whatever and they are (53:20 - 53:24)
charging (53:23 - 53:28)
$50 for it (53:24 - 53:28)
poster is it the same size it doesn&#39;t (53:30 - 53:33)
even have the frame it is the same size (53:31 - 53:37)
is 18 by 24 is the same exact size it is (53:33 - 53:40)
the same like theme like Hannah&#39;s poster (53:37 - 53:41)
is very green there&#39;s a little bit of (53:40 - 53:43)
yellow in there but it&#39;s mostly green (53:41 - 53:47)
mostly blue if you look at the um the (53:43 - 53:49)
karant one is it&#39;s a bunch of flying (53:47 - 53:52)
Pokemon it&#39;s very blue there&#39;s whites (53:49 - 53:54)
there&#39;s darker Blues they&#39;re they&#39;re not (53:52 - 53:56)
one to one but they&#39;re they&#39;re the same (53:54 - 53:58)
size the the description is exactly the (53:56 - 54:01)
same it&#39;ll say material paper country of (53:58 - 54:02)
origin printed in the (54:01 - 54:04)
USA (54:02 - 54:06)
like this is (54:04 - 54:10)
insane like first off $20 for a poster (54:06 - 54:14)
is pure profit as somebody who if you (54:10 - 54:15)
subscribe to our patreon you get a (54:14 - 54:19)
poster there&#39;s not like a lot of like (54:15 - 54:21)
what what is it like it&#39;s not very (54:19 - 54:23)
expensive to make a poster it&#39;s actually (54:21 - 54:26)
costs more money to ship a poster than (54:23 - 54:30)
it does actually make the poster um and (54:26 - 54:32)
that&#39;s and I think everyone knows that (54:30 - 54:34)
and everyone&#39;s fine with that because at (54:32 - 54:36)
the end of the day like $20 on a poster (54:34 - 54:38)
is not that big of a deal especially if (54:36 - 54:39)
it makes you happy or whatever I mean (54:38 - 54:41)
like look it like plushes are like 15 (54:39 - 54:42)
bucks and they literally don&#39;t do (54:41 - 54:44)
anything you just like put them (54:42 - 54:47)
somewhere and like that&#39;s (54:44 - 54:50)
fine it&#39;s not even like and now now to (54:47 - 54:53)
bring up inflation everything has gotten (54:50 - 54:54)
more (54:53 - 54:57)
expensive it&#39;s very like (54:54 - 55:00)
I get it it sucks like back in my day a (54:57 - 55:02)
12pack of soda used to be like $3.50 now (55:00 - 55:06)
a 12 pack of soda is like $9 it&#39;s crazy (55:02 - 55:09)
so like going from like $20 to $25 would (55:06 - 55:12)
be like yeah yeah inflation five more (55:09 - 55:14)
dollars for the same (55:12 - 55:20)
poster $50 is crazy that is so it&#39;s it&#39;s (55:14 - 55:23)
more than double like I thought at first (55:20 - 55:25)
it was like oh I I feel like they were (55:23 - 55:27)
$40 which is (55:25 - 55:30)
double I&#39;m pretty sure they were 50 I (55:27 - 55:32)
thought that they included the frames (55:30 - 55:35)
which still wouldn&#39;t be worth it (55:32 - 55:39)
but yeah I mean okay I got a 40% off (55:35 - 55:41)
coupon to Michael&#39;s right now I can get (55:39 - 55:44)
a frame 40% almost the exact same frames (55:41 - 55:46)
and they came from Ikea for maybe $5 (55:44 - 55:52)
each so the posters behind me also come (55:46 - 55:53)
from Pokemon (55:52 - 55:55)
Center how much do you think each of (55:53 - 55:57)
those posters was are slightly smaller (55:55 - 56:01)
they&#39;re 12 X8 not 18 by 24 but how much (55:57 - 56:03)
do you think each of those posters was I (56:01 - 56:05)
I weren&#39;t they like $10 a piece and then (56:03 - 56:07)
you could get the whole set for like (56:05 - 56:13)
50 they were $40 for all eight so $5 a (56:07 - 56:15)
poster 40 bucks for the whole col and (56:13 - 56:16)
they&#39;re still they&#39;re sold out now but (56:15 - 56:18)
they are still that so they have not (56:16 - 56:21)
changed the price on that it is $40 for (56:18 - 56:24)
all eight posters uh five bucks a poster (56:21 - 56:25)
the frames everything else about those (56:24 - 56:27)
posters cost a lot more than the posters (56:25 - 56:29)
they they didn&#39;t even hide the prices of (56:27 - 56:31)
the old posters you can go on (56:29 - 56:33)
pokemoncenter.com and you could see they (56:31 - 56:36)
they&#39;re sold out but listed for like (56:33 - 56:40)
$20 yep yeah the new posters I saw them (56:36 - 56:42)
I thought oh I love these sets of (56:40 - 56:43)
posters they&#39;re slightly different but I (56:42 - 56:45)
would still love to have them and keep (56:43 - 56:47)
growing my set because I have the blue (56:45 - 56:48)
one (56:47 - 56:53)
too no no $150 for the new posters no (56:48 - 56:56)
yeah that&#39;s I mean like like part of me (56:53 - 57:00)
thinks it has to be a pricing (56:56 - 57:02)
error even the van go ones weren&#39;t this (57:00 - 57:05)
expensive right (57:02 - 57:09)
like it&#39;s in (57:05 - 57:12)
insane I don&#39;t like looking at the other (57:09 - 57:14)
wall art and things on Pokemon Center (57:12 - 57:17)
I&#39;m pretty sure until you get to the (57:14 - 57:18)
there&#39;s like some really expensive wall (57:17 - 57:21)
art on Pokemon Center that&#39;s done by (57:18 - 57:25)
like specific artists H aside from that (57:21 - 57:26)
pretty sure this is like the most (57:25 - 57:28)
expensive the thing like wall art on (57:26 - 57:30)
Pokemon C are these (57:28 - 57:34)
posters okay now I I know feel free to (57:30 - 57:37)
comment on YouTube uh that&#39;s fine I know (57:34 - 57:38)
that somebody&#39;s going to be like well (57:37 - 57:41)
the paper quality could actually be (57:38 - 57:42)
better I don&#39;t know why I put a nerd (57:41 - 57:45)
voice on that there if there&#39;s one thing (57:42 - 57:48)
I know and I don&#39;t know a lot um I I I (57:45 - 57:50)
went to Milwaukee Public Schools but let (57:48 - 57:52)
me tell you I have a degree in graphic (57:50 - 57:55)
design and I had to take multiple (57:52 - 57:57)
printing classes (57:55 - 57:59)
and I had to print posters and make (57:57 - 58:02)
posters and like work an actual like (57:59 - 58:04)
physical huge printer with like blue ink (58:02 - 58:07)
and black ink and pink in and I had to (58:04 - 58:10)
like watch how it printed there ain&#39;t no (58:07 - 58:14)
difference in paper cost like there is a (58:10 - 58:17)
difference between like a a five cent (58:14 - 58:21)
piece of paper for a poster and like a (58:17 - 58:25)
dollar2 it that&#39;s it there&#39;s like a 95% (58:21 - 58:28)
95 C difference in like paper quality so (58:25 - 58:32)
to to to price your poster at more than (58:28 - 58:34)
a 100% (58:32 - 58:38)
difference is absolutely insane there is (58:34 - 58:42)
no paper out there unless that paper is (58:38 - 58:45)
like doing your taxes like there&#39;s just (58:42 - 58:49)
nothing out there to justify that cost I (58:45 - 58:52)
mean there is a Pikachu in that crar (58:49 - 58:53)
ant&#39;s (58:52 - 58:57)
mouth and they specifically on the uh (58:53 - 58:59)
description of the poster they literally (58:57 - 59:04)
say featuring Pidgeotto honch Crow deui (58:59 - 59:07)
and more parenthesis including a cameo (59:04 - 59:10)
by Pikachu in crar (59:07 - 59:13)
M all right that&#39;s worth 50 bucks there (59:10 - 59:14)
it (59:13 - 59:17)
is I&#39;m the I&#39;m the biggest crar fan in (59:14 - 59:19)

them are plenty (61:09 - 61:14)
squishy and fact if you look at the (61:11 - 61:16)
builda bear to go back to builda Bear (61:14 - 61:19)
real quick the Build-A-Bear reveal of (61:16 - 61:22)
the Munchlax I think had a little slight (61:19 - 61:25)
like there&#39;s a Foy Coco in that picture (61:22 - 61:27)
like um not to say that it&#39;s next but (61:25 - 61:29)
like there&#39;s like a f Coco in that (61:27 - 61:31)
picture and it&#39;s like maybe teasing like (61:29 - 61:32)
an upcoming build-a bear so anyway just (61:31 - 61:35)
you have other (61:32 - 61:37)
options go yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to (61:35 - 61:41)
go down like a rabbit hole of (61:37 - 61:45)
why I think the the CEO of jazz warar is (61:41 - 61:49)
a terrible dude but it&#39;s out there there (61:45 - 61:52)
are a lot of reasons very easy to find (61:49 - 61:54)
and you know it sucks because I saw a (61:52 - 61:57)
lot of people like real like people are (61:54 - 61:59)
into squish mows I totally get it um I (61:57 - 62:01)
have never purchased a squish mellow uh (61:59 - 62:04)
I&#39;ve been sent a free squish mow by the (62:01 - 62:05)
Pokemon company when they first were (62:04 - 62:06)
announced and I was definitely really (62:05 - 62:09)
excited and I think it&#39;s really (62:06 - 62:12)
easy (62:09 - 62:14)
to collect something or to be excited (62:12 - 62:18)
for something but for me personally when (62:14 - 62:20)
I find (62:18 - 62:23)
out that (62:20 - 62:26)
the person or company behind something (62:23 - 62:29)
is terrible it&#39;s really easy for me to (62:26 - 62:31)
write that off and I I use like (62:29 - 62:33)
Chick-fil-A as a really good example (62:31 - 62:35)
like Chick-fil-A is is not a great (62:33 - 62:37)
company I think it&#39;s very well known (62:35 - 62:40)
that Chick-fil-A is is is not supportive (62:37 - 62:42)
of the LGBT community and the great (62:40 - 62:44)
thing about and the great thing about (62:42 - 62:46)
that is there&#39;s plenty of places to get (62:44 - 62:49)
chicken so it&#39;s really easy for me to be (62:46 - 62:51)
like I gosh I think the last time I had (62:49 - 62:53)
Chick-fil-A was like eight years ago and (62:51 - 62:55)
that was before I knew that and as soon (62:53 - 62:57)
as I knew that I was like like okay it&#39;s (62:55 - 62:59)
easy it&#39;s very easy to go to Popeyes or (62:57 - 63:00)
KFC or (62:59 - 63:04)
literally unlimited chicken places local (63:00 - 63:05)
chicken places in your area that&#39;s the (63:04 - 63:08)
decision I made because again it&#39;s not (63:05 - 63:10)
an inconvenience to me it&#39;s so easy to (63:08 - 63:13)
find different chicken it&#39;s very easy to (63:10 - 63:15)
find different Pokemon (63:13 - 63:19)
merchandise so like if you didn&#39;t know (63:15 - 63:23)
that the CEO of of Squish Mellows is a (63:19 - 63:24)
terrible (63:23 - 63:26)
person now you do (63:24 - 63:29)
or you can you can you can look up what (63:26 - 63:31)
he said exactly and you can make that (63:29 - 63:34)
decision but uh I can&#39;t I now that I (63:31 - 63:36)
know that or now that I knew that I (63:34 - 63:40)
can&#39;t not know that so I&#39;m not going to (63:36 - 63:43)
buy squish mows that&#39;s very easy for me (63:40 - 63:47)
it&#39;s also very again easy to find (63:43 - 63:49)
different Pokemon plushes there&#39;s a lot (63:47 - 63:51)
of them out there there&#39;s a ton of (63:49 - 63:55)
different Pokemon plushes out there yeah (63:51 - 63:56)
and (63:55 - 63:59)
um speaking of that one thing that I (63:56 - 64:01)
think we didn&#39;t mention before with (63:59 - 64:04)
Pokemon plushes is uh they recently (64:01 - 64:07)
announced that the Generation 6 of the (64:04 - 64:09)
Pokemon sitting cuties is coming as well (64:07 - 64:13)
so even more options for Pokemon plushes (64:09 - 64:16)
are on way almost any Pokemon you can (64:13 - 64:19)
think of including any form of vivon (64:16 - 64:23)
which is really impressive yes yeah yeah (64:19 - 64:25)
I&#39;m I&#39;m very excited for the person to (64:23 - 64:28)
order all 10 (64:25 - 64:33)
Furrs I think there&#39;s what 19 vivon 20 (64:28 - 64:36)
yeah 20 or 20 20 and then there&#39;s nine (64:33 - 64:39)
haircuts and then one normal for (64:36 - 64:44)
f there was one item and I cannot (64:39 - 64:46)
remember which there&#39;s another Pokemon (64:44 - 64:50)
in Kaos with uh multiple forms I believe (64:46 - 64:52)
and it didn&#39;t look like they were (64:50 - 64:54)
getting they were putting them all out (64:52 - 64:56)
and I can&#39;t remember what it was some (64:54 - 64:58)

online uh xas has two forms I see I see (64:58 - 65:06)
the 10% and the 50% xerus oh wait no (65:02 - 65:09)

Stardust Pikachu cany encounter with (68:40 - 68:47)
Pikachu wearing a red party hat (68:43 - 68:47)
so I think it was like a month ago on (68:47 - 68:52)
this podcast where I was like niic (68:50 - 68:54)
should do more of these like smaller (68:52 - 68:57)
events for people who these conventions (68:54 - 69:00)
and stuff so they&#39;re doing this one (68:57 - 69:05)
that&#39;s cool um and it&#39;s in New Zealand (69:00 - 69:07)
yeah and there&#39;s an and there&#39;s an (69:05 - 69:10)
unknown spawning this is like back in (69:07 - 69:11)
the day we talked about like how they (69:10 - 69:13)
used to have like ComiCon they had all (69:11 - 69:15)
the unknown spawning for all the letters (69:13 - 69:17)
and stuff and so it&#39;s cool that you have (69:15 - 69:20)
the unknown a uh another a tip as well (69:17 - 69:22)
is it&#39;s half you said it&#39;s half Stardust (69:20 - 69:26)
cost for trades and during this season (69:22 - 69:28)
you get one additional special trade a (69:26 - 69:30)
day (69:28 - 69:35)
so if you want to chance at some cheaper (69:30 - 69:36)
special trades you&#39;ll get you know you (69:35 - 69:39)
could have two per day if you&#39;re uh (69:36 - 69:42)
during and at half cost during this (69:39 - 69:44)
event they can trade themselves (69:42 - 69:47)
relicanth all weekend yeah I feel like (69:44 - 69:49)
these are really good bonuses for an (69:47 - 69:51)
event honestly the half Stardust cost (69:49 - 69:53)
and the low modules those are really (69:51 - 69:56)
good for an event where you want to have (69:53 - 69:58)
a bunch of people playing and have other (69:56 - 70:00)
people see that and pick up the game for (69:58 - 70:02)
the first time in a (70:00 - 70:04)
while (70:02 - 70:08)
MH yeah and it&#39;s like it&#39;s not so good (70:04 - 70:10)
where people are like oh how dare they (70:08 - 70:13)
it&#39;s like good enough but not like super (70:10 - 70:16)
incredible it&#39;s a good balance (70:13 - 70:20)
yeah uh shared Skies is the new season (70:16 - 70:22)
they are doing free monthly time (70:20 - 70:26)
research for the this year uh which was (70:22 - 70:29)
was (70:26 - 70:29)
weird cuz I definitely went to the store (70:29 - 70:34)
and was like where&#39;s the paid research (70:32 - 70:36)
that I&#39;m supposed to buy for the month W (70:34 - 70:39)
they&#39;ve really got you already that you (70:36 - 70:41)
just automatically went to the shop like (70:39 - 70:43)
all right where&#39;s the $10 I&#39;m (70:41 - 70:46)
spending all right (70:43 - 70:49)
naac here&#39;s my wallet again see this is (70:46 - 70:51)
this is the difference real quick about (70:49 - 70:56)
sleep and go is that sleep you just (70:51 - 70:59)
you&#39;re paying $10 a month or whatever 50 (70:56 - 71:01)
every six months but you don&#39;t even mind (70:59 - 71:03)
right you&#39;re just like ah yes like (71:01 - 71:06)
premium $10 a month with go you went to (71:03 - 71:08)
the shop to spend the money but you (71:06 - 71:11)
weren&#39;t happy about it it was like it&#39;s (71:08 - 71:14)
true you knew you had to do it but you (71:11 - 71:18)
didn&#39;t want to it&#39;s like paying your (71:14 - 71:18)
bills it&#39;s like I got to do this (71:21 - 71:27)
to give him this money this (71:25 - 71:30)
month I need my internet so I got to pay (71:27 - 71:32)
the bill but like you (71:30 - 71:36)
know want (71:32 - 71:36)
to I mean like I I would assume that (71:36 - 71:41)
like the reason they&#39;re doing this isn&#39;t (71:40 - 71:43)
because people are mad about the Avatar (71:41 - 71:45)
or anything I think the reason they&#39;re (71:43 - 71:47)
doing this is (71:45 - 71:50)
because they know that summer time is (71:47 - 71:54)
their best time so by giving people (71:50 - 71:57)
something more to do do during their (71:54 - 71:59)
best time they will end up making more (71:57 - 72:02)
money in the long run instead of like (71:59 - 72:04)
gatekeeping those people out of being (72:02 - 72:06)
like I don&#39;t know if this $10 is worth (72:04 - 72:09)
it or not um not that like the $10 has (72:06 - 72:11)
ever been worth it to begin with it&#39;s (72:09 - 72:14)
always been like pretty mediocre yeah (72:11 - 72:15)
well that would make sense though (72:14 - 72:17)
considering the time when they usually (72:15 - 72:19)
have the most paid research tickets is (72:17 - 72:23)
the winter yeah right yep well you also (72:19 - 72:25)
have to think about what the tasks are (72:23 - 72:29)
during this search so like you know Step (72:25 - 72:32)
One is like hatch 15 eggs which (72:29 - 72:35)
obviously you can do with just the free (72:32 - 72:38)
incubator but they also introduced like (72:35 - 72:40)
a $5 bundle for three super incubators (72:38 - 72:42)
the other day and what did I do of (72:40 - 72:43)
course I went and bought the $5 bundle (72:42 - 72:45)
for three super incubator super (72:43 - 72:48)
incubators so like you know they&#39;re (72:45 - 72:49)
making their money like you said like (72:48 - 72:53)
they&#39;re making their money in other ways (72:49 - 72:53)
here uh there will also be poke stop (72:53 - 72:59)
showcases uh from Saturday to Sunday as (72:56 - 73:01)
well from Monday to (72:59 - 73:05)
Tuesday um which I still big fan of (73:01 - 73:06)
showcases personally I still think (73:05 - 73:09)
they&#39;re really great I don&#39;t honestly (73:06 - 73:10)
think there&#39;s really any downsides to (73:09 - 73:14)
them I have I I have really nothing bad (73:10 - 73:15)
to say about (73:14 - 73:18)
showcases have we talked in this podcast (73:15 - 73:20)
about have you talked on this podcast (73:18 - 73:22)
about what you get for 100 showcase (73:20 - 73:24)
wins no we never talked about the (73:22 - 73:26)
Pikachu that you get you get that (73:24 - 73:29)
special Pikachu wearing like the what is (73:26 - 73:31)

that costume yeah it&#39;s the scientist one (73:31 - 73:34)
right scientist Pikachu yeah I just (73:33 - 73:35)
didn&#39;t know if there was like an (73:34 - 73:37)
official name for that costumed Pikachu (73:35 - 73:39)
but it&#39;s like a scientist it&#39;s got the (73:37 - 73:43)
lab code and the glasses on um for 100 (73:39 - 73:47)
showcase wins I will tell you right now (73:43 - 73:50)
that I am not I haven&#39;t found a good (73:47 - 73:52)
place to do showcases where there aren&#39;t (73:50 - 73:56)
180 people also in the that&#39;s what we (73:52 - 73:57)
get for living in cities I have never (73:56 - 73:59)
won a showcase yeah I&#39;ve never won a (73:57 - 74:01)
showcase so people were showing the (73:59 - 74:02)
Showcase (74:01 - 74:05)
metal have I don&#39;t have metal I&#39;ve never (74:02 - 74:09)
won one yeah maybe I&#39;ve gotten in third (74:05 - 74:12)
once maybe I think I&#39;m in third right (74:09 - 74:15)
now for one but I know that&#39;s going to (74:12 - 74:19)
change to like 12th before it&#39;s over (74:15 - 74:22)
mhm yeah showcases definitely (74:19 - 74:24)
benefit people who live in the middle of (74:22 - 74:26)
nowhere that&#39;s for sure it&#39;s like the (74:24 - 74:27)
one (74:26 - 74:31)
thing yeah seriously but also about I&#39;ve (74:27 - 74:34)
won seven okay there there&#39;s that&#39;s (74:31 - 74:38)
something that&#39;s almost you know 10% of (74:34 - 74:39)
I guess it&#39;s 7% of the way there to the (74:38 - 74:44)
to the Pikachu but uh I also about six (74:39 - 74:46)
months ago nine months ago right before (74:44 - 74:48)
showcases came out so maybe what was it (74:46 - 74:50)
a year ago that they came out maybe or (74:48 - 74:54)
within the last year yeah um I decided I (74:50 - 74:57)
was collecting too many different things (74:54 - 75:00)
so I was going to throw out all of my I (74:57 - 75:01)
had been collecting I kept every double (75:00 - 75:05)
XL um Pokemon that I had uh you know (75:01 - 75:07)
found and then I decided to throw them (75:05 - 75:09)
all out and like four days later they&#39;re (75:07 - 75:10)
like we&#39;re introducing this thing where (75:09 - 75:12)
it&#39;s good to have Jumbo (75:10 - 75:17)
Pokemon so that&#39;s not (75:12 - 75:19)
great um obviously when we&#39;re recording (75:17 - 75:22)
this it is gooy Community Day June 9th (75:19 - 75:23)
uh this podcast will come out on June (75:22 - 75:27)
10th uh June 22nd will be Community Day (75:23 - 75:30)
classic uh which will be syndic Quil and (75:27 - 75:35)
then July 21st will be a new community (75:30 - 75:37)
day they haven&#39;t said what it was is yet (75:35 - 75:41)
but I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s going to be poo (75:37 - 75:44)
I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s the that&#39;s the thought (75:41 - 75:48)
I think and then if poo is not July it&#39; (75:44 - 75:50)
probably be August which August 31st and (75:48 - 75:52)
thank goodness they decided not to do (75:50 - 75:55)
ComEd day overworlds that was such a (75:52 - 75:58)
nightmare last (75:55 - 75:58)
year um what is worlds like the 16th (75:59 - 76:05)
17th 18th so it&#39;s like the week after (76:03 - 76:06)

don&#39;t remember yeah um there&#39;s new (76:06 - 76:12)
stickers go battle League (76:09 - 76:15)
reset research breakthroughs your your (76:12 - 76:18)
options are huan growth Larvitar aino (76:15 - 76:22)
axu furu and jangma all of these will be (76:18 - 76:25)
shiny although jangma o will start um (76:22 - 76:28)
during go Fest So eventually it&#39;ll be (76:25 - 76:31)
shiny it&#39;s just not shiny as of right (76:28 - 76:34)
now different Pokemon in the (76:31 - 76:37)
wild different eggs I could go through (76:34 - 76:39)
all of this stuff but like literally (76:37 - 76:42)
nothing is that (76:39 - 76:45)
exciting yeah I I will say with speaking (76:42 - 76:47)
of Jang moo we talked about this earlier (76:45 - 76:51)
but let everyone&#39;s reminder B and sorry (76:47 - 76:53)
for the people that went to Sendai (76:51 - 76:56)
already that you don&#39;t need to get like (76:53 - 76:59)
there will be a community day of like (76:56 - 77:01)
Jang moo next year like goom&#39;s Community (76:59 - 77:03)
day today is the reminder that next year (77:01 - 77:05)
there will be a community day of the (77:03 - 77:07)
Pokemon that&#39;s very popular at the Go (77:05 - 77:09)
Fest this year yes but also this is (77:07 - 77:12)
weirdly only a reminder for Global go (77:09 - 77:14)
Fest this year oh that&#39;s true it&#39;s not (77:12 - 77:19)
actually has yet so one thing I did (77:14 - 77:22)
appreciate last year at go Fest was that (77:19 - 77:26)
g was available in the wild (77:22 - 77:28)
like I caught two shiny Gom in the wild (77:26 - 77:31)
at go fest last year whereas the years (77:28 - 77:34)
prior like axu and the previous ones it (77:31 - 77:38)
was only raids raid only so you had to (77:34 - 77:40)
raid if you wanted to try for the shiny (77:38 - 77:43)
um so that was nice to not that they (77:40 - 77:45)
actually expanded that a little bit and (77:43 - 77:49)
had it in the wild I was in the wild too (77:45 - 77:51)
was actu in the wild it if it was it was (77:49 - 77:54)
super rare in the wild I feel like go (77:51 - 77:56)
was a little bit more common last year I (77:54 - 77:59)
think did fil more Comm yeah is Jang moo (77:56 - 78:00)
going to be in the wild for go Fest (77:59 - 78:03)
Global or only in (78:00 - 78:06)
raids I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve said they (78:03 - 78:08)
also said that Umbreon and Espeon were (78:06 - 78:09)
supposed to be in three star raids (78:08 - 78:11)
during Cai let me tell you what didn&#39;t (78:09 - 78:14)
exist Umbreon and Espeon and three star (78:11 - 78:15)
raids not a single (78:14 - 78:19)
one really there there was no raids of (78:15 - 78:22)
Umbreon and Espeon that entire weekend (78:19 - 78:25)
that&#39;s weird they were in the wild which (78:22 - 78:30)
was very nice um better I guess it is (78:25 - 78:32)
better but that (78:30 - 78:37)
was very that literally on their (78:32 - 78:39)
website remember that sticker that I got (78:37 - 78:43)
for free by buying something in a store (78:39 - 78:45)
and I scanned the QR code because I (78:43 - 78:46)
thought it was going to give me (78:45 - 78:48)
something and it took me to niantic&#39;s (78:46 - 78:50)
website to say like this is go Fest (78:48 - 78:52)
Sendai and I was like yep still says (78:50 - 78:54)
that Umbreon and ESPN are supposed to be (78:52 - 78:55)
in three star (78:54 - 78:58)
[Laughter] (78:55 - 79:01)
they are not here so not only did it not (78:58 - 79:05)
give you something it sent you to (79:01 - 79:07)
misinformation yeah that misinformation (79:05 - 79:11)
being Niantic themselves yeah well it (79:07 - 79:13)
looks like Jang moo along with being in (79:11 - 79:15)
one star raids is supposed to be in one (79:13 - 79:18)
of the habitats in the wild so we&#39;ll see (79:15 - 79:21)
if that&#39;s (79:18 - 79:21)
right the following bonuses is are one (79:22 - 79:28)
additional special trade per day which (79:26 - 79:30)
is what Bobby mentioned earlier trainers (79:28 - 79:32)
above level 31 and higher will have a (79:30 - 79:35)
higher chance of receiving XL candy when (79:32 - 79:36)
exploring with their (79:35 - 79:39)
buddy not catching Pokemon walking with (79:36 - 79:42)
your buddy and then increased XP for (79:39 - 79:46)
First Catch of the Day (79:42 - 79:50)
um I I feel like the the special trade (79:46 - 79:51)
is is really great one additional (79:50 - 79:53)
special trade is always very good I (79:51 - 79:55)
think um (79:53 - 79:57)
I don&#39;t think the other ones are that (79:55 - 80:01)
thrilling or exciting uh no like XL (79:57 - 80:03)
candy is still such a grind and still (80:01 - 80:07)
like pretty Niche like I think I only (80:03 - 80:09)
have like two three Pokemon at level 50 (80:07 - 80:10)
and it&#39;s only cuz I think to get from (80:09 - 80:13)
like level 47 to 48 you needed to get (80:10 - 80:15)
three Pokemon to level 50 as like the (80:13 - 80:18)
task is it only three okay yeah it&#39;s (80:15 - 80:21)
only three yeah it&#39;s only three um and (80:18 - 80:23)
part of the reason it&#39;s it&#39;s like I have (80:21 - 80:26)
the candy I just don&#39;t want to spend the (80:23 - 80:27)
Stardust I&#39;d rather just save the (80:26 - 80:29)
Stardust for (80:27 - 80:32)
trades right I I feel like unless you (80:29 - 80:37)
are someone who does PVP or like to raid (80:32 - 80:40)
with the minimal amount of people to try (80:37 - 80:43)
for um like certain raids with like the (80:40 - 80:44)
the most the least people you can do (80:43 - 80:47)
that with then you don&#39;t need to power (80:44 - 80:49)
your Pokemon up past level 40 like you (80:47 - 80:52)
don&#39;t need to use XL candy like yeah I (80:49 - 80:54)
have had kind of the same level 40 (80:52 - 80:56)
Pokemon (80:54 - 80:58)
since getting to level 40 years ago and (80:56 - 81:01)
they just continuously like they raid (80:58 - 81:03)
fine and you know I&#39;m not missing out on (81:01 - 81:05)
any raids or anything because I don&#39;t (81:03 - 81:07)
have level 50 Pokemon or something above (81:05 - 81:11)
level 40 level 50 is a very PVP thing (81:07 - 81:15)
yeah for sure for sure so I get it if (81:11 - 81:18)
you especially if you are on if you play (81:15 - 81:20)
if you&#39;re PVP and you do that but (81:18 - 81:22)
otherwise yeah I don&#39;t think XL candies (81:20 - 81:26)
are I mean I like getting them I think (81:22 - 81:28)
that it&#39;s important for them to be more (81:26 - 81:30)
accessible and be able to let trainers (81:28 - 81:32)
level their Pokemon up to 50 I just (81:30 - 81:34)
don&#39;t think this is a particularly good (81:32 - 81:38)
bonus for that yeah yeah I honestly I (81:34 - 81:41)
still really miss holding 40 (81:38 - 81:43)
gifts yeah (81:41 - 81:48)
M yep when you have a friends list as (81:43 - 81:50)
long as you can have a friends list yeah (81:48 - 81:52)
you&#39;re not able to send gifts to (81:50 - 81:55)
everyone as frequently otherwise also (81:52 - 81:58)
like I normally send gifts uh on like (81:55 - 82:00)
public transportation or like right (81:58 - 82:03)
before I go to bed like when I&#39;m like (82:00 - 82:05)
when I&#39;m out and (82:03 - 82:07)
about doing raids or catching Pokemon (82:05 - 82:09)
I&#39;m just not stopping to send gifts (82:07 - 82:11)
because it&#39;s timec consuming right so (82:09 - 82:13)
it&#39;s like when I&#39;m ready to send gifts (82:11 - 82:15)
it&#39;s it&#39;s usually I&#39;m not around any (82:13 - 82:17)
stops (82:15 - 82:21)
so yeah it&#39;s nice to have like double (82:17 - 82:22)
that to be like okay before I go to bed (82:21 - 82:24)
I&#39;m going to send all my gifts and then (82:22 - 82:25)
tomorrow when I go out and play I&#39;ll be (82:24 - 82:30)
able to replenish versus you actually I (82:25 - 82:32)
don&#39;t so I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m I (82:30 - 82:36)
don&#39;t send gifts to anybody I&#39;m so baded (82:32 - 82:39)
here I&#39;m such a bad friend in Pokemon (82:36 - 82:43)
go H I think when when (82:39 - 82:46)
iord I think it&#39;s easier to send an open (82:43 - 82:49)
gifts when you know that you&#39;re going to (82:46 - 82:52)
see that person MH so for sure so I&#39;m (82:49 - 82:55)
I&#39;m I&#39;m also pretty bad at it right but (82:52 - 82:56)
like for me it was really easy to send (82:55 - 82:58)
gifts while I was in Japan cuz I was on (82:56 - 83:00)
like the train and I was getting really (82:58 - 83:02)
cool gifts and I wanted to send people (83:00 - 83:04)
Japanese gifts right and I wasn&#39;t (83:02 - 83:06)
driving because like now that I&#39;m back (83:04 - 83:08)
in America I gotta drive everywhere so I (83:06 - 83:09)
can&#39;t I can&#39;t send gifts and drive at (83:08 - 83:11)
the same time but I can definitely sit (83:09 - 83:12)
on a 20- minute train ride and send 20 (83:11 - 83:15)
gifts before that train ride&#39;s over um (83:12 - 83:17)
but like because I&#39;m going to see so (83:15 - 83:19)
many people at New York go Fest it&#39;s (83:17 - 83:21)
like okay I prior I like renamed all (83:19 - 83:23)
those people New York I&#39;m making sure (83:21 - 83:25)
that they get gifts I&#39;m opening gifts (83:23 - 83:26)
and then ideally if we&#39;re already (83:25 - 83:28)
fourstar friends it&#39;s like can we get (83:26 - 83:30)
lucky before New York (83:28 - 83:32)
because that would be great I would love (83:30 - 83:35)
to do more lucky trades in New York yeah (83:32 - 83:37)
yeah I think I think part of the problem (83:35 - 83:40)
for me is that if I need to do more of (83:37 - 83:41)
like that renaming because what&#39;ll (83:40 - 83:43)
happen is I&#39;ll add friends and then I (83:41 - 83:46)
won&#39;t remember like oh who is that like (83:43 - 83:48)
this is why you rame you give them a (83:46 - 83:50)
nickname as soon as you add the friend (83:48 - 83:53)
that way you can remember who they are (83:50 - 83:57)
yeah I system for in this then you know (83:53 - 84:00)
that would work well but uh you know me (83:57 - 84:02)
well enough to know I&#39;m not doing that I (84:00 - 84:04)
rename people so I remember where I met (84:02 - 84:07)
them and what their actual name is yeah (84:04 - 84:09)
no that&#39;s that&#39;s the smart way to do it (84:07 - 84:12)
that&#39;s the smart way to do (84:09 - 84:12)
it um I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s (84:13 - 84:19)
pretty much it uh (84:15 - 84:24)
this there should be a I have to record (84:19 - 84:26)
one more podcast before I leave for (84:24 - 84:29)
Madrid so whatever podcast goes (84:26 - 84:33)
up on the on the 17th might not have the (84:29 - 84:37)
latest or breaking news because I don&#39;t (84:33 - 84:39)
I just don&#39;t want to Lug all my audio (84:37 - 84:41)
equipment I already have to Lug enough (84:39 - 84:43)
equipment to a different (84:41 - 84:45)
country although when I went through the (84:43 - 84:49)
airport last time I could see my bag (84:45 - 84:50)
almost always gets (84:49 - 84:53)
flagged um because a bunch of cables and (84:50 - 84:55)
a bunch of microphones kind of don&#39;t (84:53 - 84:58)
look great in an X-ray scanner but I (84:55 - 85:00)
remember when I was like leaving for (84:58 - 85:03)
Japan my bag went through and the guy (85:00 - 85:05)
looked at me and then he looked back at (85:03 - 85:07)
the scanner and he looked at me and he (85:05 - 85:09)
looked back at the scanner and he goes (85:07 - 85:12)
audio equipment and I said yeah and then (85:09 - 85:15)
he was like yes and then he like (85:12 - 85:17)
high-fived the other security guard like (85:15 - 85:22)
he guessed correctly what was in my (85:17 - 85:22)
back that was a win for that person I (85:23 - 85:30)
guess like made his day I guess (85:25 - 85:34)
um but I will be at Madrid in Madrid at (85:30 - 85:36)
Madrid I&#39;ll be in Madrid this weekend (85:34 - 85:38)
for go Fest I should be streaming it on (85:36 - 85:40)
Twitch although there are six hours in (85:38 - 85:43)
the future I believe so go Fest starts (85:40 - 85:44)
at 9:00 am which means my twitch streams (85:43 - 85:47)
will start 300 a.m central time which is (85:44 - 85:50)
really early but if you wake up on (85:47 - 85:52)
Friday or Saturday and you need (85:50 - 85:55)
something to watch I&#39;ll Be There (85:52 - 85:58)
