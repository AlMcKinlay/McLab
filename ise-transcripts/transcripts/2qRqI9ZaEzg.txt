and with me today i have will so did oh my gosh for moving on i also ha dude I'm trying to keep a cheerful in here no matter how hard you try to bring me down I feel like that's like a meme for like 2010 probably but that's what we run on here the power of memes all right Travis all your base is belong to us are belong to us if we're being specific Steve I am so glad that you have invited me onto this dungeons and dragon Heights spin-off show where we just talk about Pokemon i'm not i'm not sure how successful it's gonna be you know i'm not sure i'm just talking about Pokemon has legs taking the D&D bit of it away but you know I'm flattered either way might have been your best intro for 2016 there traffic it might be my only intro for 2016 I feel like it's been a long time since I met on the show ya know well yeah it well in the last couple of weeks for podcasting have been so weird with c2 and then this past weekend I had company over and it was WrestleMania weekend and so I couldn't record yeah now that we're doing the dungeon dragon knights stream on Tuesday nights and the twist stuff on Thursday night it's just I'm that I'm not blaming you it's just a lot I i took on a lot on my plate at once which is it's fine i like creating content and like the patreon is growing and so that just like every time like there's a new patreon back or even if it's like a dollar i'm just like how can like i do more for the backers cuz it like it it's exciting it's really cool that like they're like supporting what we do here mmm you guys just kind of show up but i know but i got you know it's for every dollar they put in the bucket we tell one more joke per episode yeah that's it that's it's the behind-the-scenes i had a but low if you are new to it's super effective and i just preference that because we've been sitting in the top like 50 of games & hobbies for ever since sun and moon has been announced we've been doing very well we're we're up like twenty percent and downloads to see how i used i used a percentage since i didn't reveal our actual oh this is a different spin off than i thought this is the spin-off where we talk about how the podcast is doing this is the this is the podcast where we talked about at what position our podcast is I'm on the wrong show I gotta go this is this is one now this is statistics cast and he's got a counterpoint by telling me how I completely screwed up my other spin-off podcast and and how that has no numbers d remembers I was gonna say I was gonna say though that you know the show's been doing really good so we've been getting new listeners so I want a preference that we purposely spend the first 10 to 15 minutes of our episodes not talking about Pokemon disregarding her intro that was a bit pokemon focused but I oh I so what I ended up doing as as my friends were coming into town for Wrestlemania and everything is I cleaned my whole house started cleaning the basement because I was also getting ready for Midwest game and classic which is we're recording this on Wednesday night not our typical recording schedule and Midwest gaming classic is held in your basement yes it's held in my basement it is held at the Sheraton Hotel in brookfield Wisconsin so I've trying to get everything organized I usually bring four or five totes worth of stuff to you know set up the show and whatnot so I'm emptying totes and cleaning and everything and I open this tote and it's nothing of like blu rays and dvds and xbox 360 games it's been in my basement since I moved here which was almost two years ago I was like I I don't want at the tote that these that are holding this this media is worth more than the media its itself like I would rather have the tote then the tote hold this garbage that I have to move when I eventually move and so I went to the Amazon training program and entered true romance DVD forty cents perfect fine take it I end up doing that for you're only allowed to do 50 items per transaction I did 150 items they were blu-rays they were GameCube games Xbox games ps2 games dvds I walked away with six hundred dollars hey and I got three totes that I could use in my basement so not only did I save space but I got rid of a bunch of junk and I have a 600 ollar amazon gift card coming my way so that was my very exciting weekend that wasn't actually really that exciting in retrospect but huh what about you guys what's up I have a confession to make i I'm sorry I bought skyrim in 2016 again again cuz it's a it's a game I already own why I was like why is that a question it's a game I already own and the disk is back at my parents house and it was on the 360 and I wanted to play it on the pc and so I just bought it again we'll have expansion because I hadn't played any of the expansions and it hadn't occurred to me that game came out in 2011 five years ago which first of all that's wild seems like that was yesterday and second of all it's it's still really fun and that's all I did last weekend was play a five year old video game like it's not even old enough to be like yeah I busted out banjo kazooie again it was like oh man all the all the nostalgia all the the facebook posts about oh you BuzzFeed's list of 12 games that only 90s kids no number 60 shot you it's banjo kazooie it's not even that like there's no nostalgia it's just I don't know I like walking into caves and then dispatching what's inside and then going to the next identical cave and then crouching and waiting for somebody to turn around and feel everything off their plate is that you got to steal things off people's tables that's one of the things you can do yeah it's a it's it's a table simulator it's like that tabletop simulator except instead of playing board games you just take things off of tables when people aren't looking why why would you know do such a thing why would you play a five-year-old game no my question was why would you not dabble in something new like elder scrolls online the ESO as the kids call it because it's supposed to be like awful isn't it I mean it's it's what I that's also a table clearing game all I've heard is that it's pretty bad it's fine I mean I don't like Elder Scrolls to begin with and when I played it to me it felt like elder scrolls except with all the people running around yes that's the worst part it would I want to share anything with anyone that's true yet well how about you well I'm had one of the worst weekend's of my life or at least one of the worst weekend's of my recent life because I got called into work on saturday and i had to work most of saturday because the internet at the University went down and I had to test all kinds of garbage not like I could actually fix the problem and then Sunday morning and we had another outage and I had to get up early and work on that and figure out to help people figure out what's going on and then Sunday night my one redemption for the weekend was supposed to be watching WrestleMania and and I couldn't because WWE messed up real bad and they're gonna lose one hundred and twenty dollars for me I mean the period they did email you earlier in the week okay I are I am like a modern person I don't use email anymore and besides that laughter fine fine that's great they sent a notification this is 2016 you test your app sufficiently especially like if it's on a restricted number of platforms before your biggest event of the year you do not release an update that makes it this so that your loyal customers who have been paying ten dollars a month for an entire year can't get into the freaking app to watch the one thing that they want to see after they're horrible horrible weekend of having to work and being very unhappy yeah I'm not sure you're you're not wrong like obviously we're in an age where if you need to reset your password and you can't because they're doing maintenance or their service or there's too much traffic because I think they had they came out and said there was two million subscribers at that point in time because it was you could sign up for free trial or not I mean that's still broken and you couldn't get access and yeah they emailed you saying like hey make sure you can successfully log in before this weekend because you might not be able to if you don't test ahead of time while they did alert you and I and everyone else there there really is no excuse why as a paying customer you got locked out like i'm not i'm not sure what the technical aspect is i'm just letting i was just stating that they didn't let everyone know via email whether but read honest honestly and truly I get 200 to 300 email messages a day I just don't have time to catch and I'm sorry but WWE literally emails every other day hey we've got new t-shirt designs hey make sure you watch Raw Monday night hey watch make sure you watch a Thursday night you know and I see one email from WWE I'm like it's just gonna be another promotion I'm gonna ignore it right but here's the thing i watch on my ps4 I have the app installed on my ps4 but Sony sends out notifications about all kinds of garbage all the time and I read them because I actually don't get that many notifications on the ps4 and it pops up when I turn on the ps4 it pops up and says we have a message for you and I look at it couldn't the WWE have pushed out a message through the ps4 system I have the WWE app on my phone couldn't they have done a notification through that it's their biggest event of the year oh so angry you know what I do in a situation like this I hit em to pull my world map fast travel to solitude take out the bow and I just take out all my anger on the Eagles that are perpetually flying over solitude I take some hawk feathers I guess they're Hawks because they drop hawk feathers shouldn't notice that you know and I make myself some I think they make like resists fire potions or something you know it really it it's a really call me experience I think you should try it this episode brought to you by Skyrim a five year old game what I did was I ended up watching pokemon XY and z at that car team is probably about her it was real good oh well what did you that would have been a good transition day you said Pokemon right now keep go but I really wanted to ask did you actually end up watching WrestleMania yet no no I'm done I am done I am anybody who wants my WWE t-shirts give me your address I'll put them in the mail to you I am done with WWE canceling my subscription not putting up with any of this garbage anymore you heard at your first breaking news speaking of news got some pokemon news we just got a little bit a little bit of pokemon news we talked last well let's get the let's get the obvious thing out of the way here there was a Pokemon house I don't know what the show is actually called in Japanese but I think in English it translates to Pokemon house I think it's at oak n chi booking G there was rumors and speculation that there was going to be some Pokemon Sun and Moon details revealed if you go back and look at the official statement and I think that was on serebii and some other places by know for sure it was on serebii it stated that it will show first-ever footage on TV and somehow that got translated into other websites as first-ever gameplay footage when going back to the original press release said first-ever footage why did what ended up happening is on Pokemon house they showed the trailer that we have already seen for sun and moon they just showed that again as a commercial in between the breaks of Pokemon house and that was it then they also give us a release window that was more specific than what we had known previously I don't think is it then they like give us a month but they did now nothing else I somebody on the show said there will be more than 10 new Pokemon so that did come out of it yeah I couldn't like the amount of anger that the internet had out this that like all these websites lied to them about game footage and they did lie like know where we did it state game footage like if you go to that original article original press statement whatever you want to call it like it they only said footage and ever the the word game was just put in by other sites to drive traffic and to build excitement that wasn't there so I expected nothing because nothing really comes out of those shows and I got nothing and that was okay for me yeah and I think it's just like do you know well Steve you don't know Travis you may know when you're at the at the bar and you've had a couple of beers and then you have to go to the bathroom and that's called you know the first time you do it it's called breaking the seal and then from that point forward you have to go to the bathroom more frequently um that's what they've done they've broken the seal so now they're gonna have to give us more and more footage as time goes on they can't go back to a time of silence so you wouldn't know about that because he's not 21 yet right yeah well no cuz Steve does not drink Abby I know I'm joking my 12 every body cannot handle beer in his life the beer we got some more Wi-Fi competitions here the flash crash Wi-Fi competition was announced this will be players will be able to register starting on April 21st through April twenty-eighth the Wi-Fi competition itself will run April 29th room a first results will be announced in May competition is one on one or participants will have six pokemon in the battle box but will only bring one of each Pokemon into battle legendary and mythical Pokemon cannot be used in this tournament participants may only use Pokemon from Omega Ruby alpha sapphire games Pokemon cannot be brought over from Jennifer generation 5b used in this tournament all Pokemon below level 50 and above will automate movie sets of 50 I'll battles will last a maximum of five minutes players will have 30 seconds to decide which Pokemon they want to battle with they will have 10 seconds to attack her to switch and you may battle 20 times a day for a total of sixty battles players Pokemon may not hold mega stones focus sash or soul do what do you guys think I think it can be a lot of fun because a lot of people complain that singles is too slow so this is obviously implementing something to make it sped up absolutely I think I'm it did I miss something it sounds like it's a it's a it's like a one-on-one like just one each player brings they bring six pick one yes am i understanding it correctly yeah I've they've had formats like that a lot of the simulators like that's been on showdown in stuff for a while it's weird if you get weird stuff well I mean I guess they're banning focus sash so that's different than I've heard of before but you get sort of weird strategies where stuff that would normally you wouldn't normally see in in just a normal singles match because it's just sort of a weird gimmick that only gets you one KO and then usually your serve left vulnerable when they get a free switchin becomes a lot more usable nothing immediately is coming to mind but I think I'm remembering back a while I think people would do a lot of stuff with like togekiss and serene grace and just bank on flinch chance and just not give the other Pokemon a chance because it's not like you can just switch into a defensive pokemon and and slap a toxic on it or whatever yeah I guess I mean you're looking at their six you have your six I mean you could be in a situation where you pick a water pokemon they picked an electric and not much you can do they're like the water pokemon you picked was Lantern I suppose yes or you were faster and you have a ground-type move or yeah wish cash nice a lot of water grounds do some uh some work with Swampert in this India clearly in this electric-type meta that will does dominated by electric types I mean that's why it's called the flash crash ah speaking of electric types there is a new pokemon type quiz what's your pokemon type you could take a quiz on Pokemon telecom to find out surprisingly you won't be hearing a lot from me cuz I'm gonna take that right now there's a actually quite a bit of questions I want to say there was 12 13 questions if i remember correctly i ended up buying it's gonna be even longer than i thought that i will be talking i ended up getting electric-type as my pokemon type Wow which is I think interesting at one point it does ask you what your like favorite type is i think if i remember right that's okay i get away give away and no I put water maybe it was like a baby I read the question wrong cuz i was doing at my phone in a car wash like real quickly before the car wash n ended but well maybe it was what was your favorite type battle against but i thought it said what was your favorite type and I was like oh here we go water because that's what I wanted but it Italy there's like a zoo bet question that it asks there's a question link to the show that i'm recording this is this is for this is for the listener so that they might more easily find the quiz um where where is this it would be pokemon 20.com and then there tons of fun listener is there tons of Pokemon fun i believe unzip okay got it that's a great adding to go on i'm certainly not taking a quiz while you're talking alright cool as travis takes that i'll actually have the quiz up here 2 4 6 8 and 12 for 15 question the other bad news we have here is you can get your mythical Pokemon jirachi from april first to april twenty fourth yeah you get that right from the nintendo network no gamestop needed jirachi is level 100 steal psychic-type ability serene grace move our wish confusion and rest on top of getting uh you can get this in x and y or Omega Ruby alpha sapphire works for any of those four games on top of that you can go to gamestop and toys r us they have Sorachi plushies actually i don't think they're getting games that this time I think they're exclusive to toys r us if i'm not mistaken because i know some of the stores switch back and forth depending on what month it is and the last bit of news i have here is that you'll be able to get hidden ability Moltres Zapdos and Articuno the district a distribution coming in may to celebrate the 20th anniversary with a whole bunch of free pokemon pokemons doing this again they will in order to get Moltres aptos and Articuno you will have to sign up for the pokemon trainer club newsletter by april twenty second and you will get codes for these three pokemon this will work for Omega Ruby alpha sapphire and x and y for North America and it says Europe as well here hidden abilities they will be distributed at level 70 they will have hidden abilities they will have the following attacks Articuno will come with snow cloak and no freeze dry ice beam hail and reflect Zapdos will have static and no discharge thundershock rain dance and agility Moltres will have flame body and no sky attack heat wave sunny day and safeguard like I said these will be a level 70 you need to sign up for the Pokemon newsletter and if you have not done that before just go to Pokemon com you have to create a pokemon trainer club account if you already have an account login make sure that you have the newsletter option on when you create your account for the first time just go through and make sure you select that newsletter option and it's if I don't know if I just said this but those the email with the codes will come around april twenty second so i did it did it did it we got a breaking news bulletin I was out I'd say I had a breaking news bulletin hey could you both don't you breaking news bullet over my breaking news bulletin just take the quiz yes okay is that what both of our both of our news bulletins and the word yes I guess we'll find out but yeah I got I got ferry who's surprised by that I don't think ice was it was an option ice is my favorite type but I don't think ice was in there because at the part where I was like if you're a gym leader or what would your type B is was not there so yeah ferry is probably the next best thing did it ask what your favorite type was at one point or am i imagining things no it asked you or a gym leader while Pokemon would you predominantly use oh these different questions when you take it that might have been like oh no no I got this I got the same question cuz I said water cuz that was one of the options well what did you get well there was a reason why i had not taken this quiz before when i saw the answers that other people were posting on the social medias and i ended up as disappointed as i expected to be i got normal type i would assume that ice is one of the options why would it not be there's only like six there's how many 17 pokemon types and there's only like six options for each question yeah but there's enough questions to develop her mutations that would end up with any of the 17 right but i think that i don't think it one of the quizzes that works like that I think it's one of the ones where there's there's six possible and whatever one you get you another yes to pick up in four for all these questions because then I don't have to move my mouse or trackpad all right almost done here this is making for great great podcasting material all right I picked option for for all the questions my type of steel alright i'm doing option six for all the questions and my i'll do option once all the way I'm going to abstain from this not the more make andheri world breaking radio yes why I'm abstaining from this I don't I don't support the falsification of Pokemon type quiz results yes if you vote up you voter fraud see if that's the only way we can get Bernie and I'm all for it um oh we just got political uh I I got ferry by selecting all of the sixth answers I got fire by selecting all of the first answers all right enough quizzes if you want to if you want to take the quiz know what type you are in cheat or not cheat you can go to Pokemon 20.com and hit the tons of fun button up in the upper top area this is more important than knowing what house you're in and uh in whatever that school is the Harry Potters go to the Gryffindor oh no no I'm no Gryffindor sir I am in Gryffindor I took my quiz so what we'll do is we'll take a quick break and then when we come back we've got some emails to tackle as well as our pokemon of the week so we will be right back and we are back from our amazing break as Travis plated I picked option to for all of the Pokemon quiz and I got fighting-type I believe that all the types are there I just don't believe the algorithm is that fantastic all right I'll take your word for it what do we got what we got what we got we got emails love you want to send an email for us as we try to do the segment as often as we can you can do so by setting an email over to SBJ at pkmn casscom or you can go to Pokemon podcast calm and go ahead and hit that contact button and you can fill out the form there too and that'll that'll get you to the email part as well the first email I got here is from James he says hey guys I love Pokemon growing up being about nine years old when red and blue first came out I played the games right of the cards watch the anime then in middle school then middle school happened and unfortunately I didn't have the self and self-esteem to to to keep doing something I enjoyed that was unpopular then with all the hype for the 20th anniversary I decided to find out what was happening in the world that I missed I found your show started listening and since then I've started playing x and y and Omega Ruby alpha sapphire I regret missing all that time but I'm glad to be back you guys made me excited to be a trainer again Thank You Jimmy well that's really nice um I'm happy that he's enjoying playing the game again or playing the games again um I would not play x and y and alpha omega ruby alpha sapphire at the same time you know play them one at a time but or just you know I'll play the better one x and y well we read what if all pokemon shuffle he went out again toward 43 ds's playing all four at once got a more power dining ponyta there there's some real work he was just listening to his favorite band sum 41 um I'm glad to hear that uh that your back into it mmm flattered that that we played a part in that that's awesome it's awesome yep Todd rights in here just found your podcast last week and I started with your podcast about sun and moon I was thinking about the new games and as I was watching organs he wrote origins but we know what it is we know we know what they met yes I was thinking Sun and Moon could be a game where new Pokemon will be introduced as well as bringing more light to the mega stones and mega evolution so far we barely know anything about it and I feel like I feel like it's time to bring a fourth evolution to light and if it doesn't answer Sun and Moon and if it doesn't get answered in sun and moon it would feel like a cop-out what do you think had well mega evolutions a fourth evolution well it isn't it isn't so it's not permanent yes so it all depends on what is is okay bill clinton let me riff on true 80s babies s is so sure um let me um just follow through on that in my watching of pokemon XY and z which I do highly recommend that every pokemon fan watch that cartoon and not wait for it to get to Netflix because it's good now in the most recent episode they actually redid the first reveal of ash greninja and what it was was not like in the Pokemon burst comics where the pokemon trainer actually merges with a Pokemon and they become one unified being um ash and greninja stayed separate but the greninja kind of did like the burst in token tournament did i pronounce it correctly this time Pocan um where it just becomes more powerful it did have some appearance changes and there was just that moment where it was like a union of the fighting spirit of ash and the greninja that caused it to happen but they did remain as separate beings they did not merge together so all of your Digimon fears can be set aside and put your last um so I do think that they're going to be in investigating the the burst concept of enhancing your pokémon's power um possibly not in the way of an evolution or fourth evolution but just threw a burst event um the nice thing is I think that that's going to be able to apply to all Pokemon as opposed to them having to determine which pokemons get which did I say pokemons Wow which Pokemon get mega suited from the cast I just I don't like sounding ignorant I gotta I gotta hide my ignorance I mean I'm all for being wrong the I don't okay I don't see them ever tackling the fourth evolution at this point I think that with mega evolution you you get that benefit of what a quote-unquote fourth evolution would look like without bogging down the pokédex I don't know why I bet mega be drills my example for everything but if you look at mega Beedrill he's clearly way cooler has a different ability bigger everything everything in evolution of Beedrill would have but you also but you get the benefits of okay that's eight at the end of the day he still be drill so you're not getting another pokedex ember and also because he's not considered of fourth evolution we don't have to come up with another bunny named to stick onto that we just put the word mega before it and people are satisfied and I think that that thought process or that mechanic that Pokemon designed is actually really clever and how many mega Pokemon do we have 60 70 maybe maybe less maybe I'm exaggerating that number but that's six years 70 less Pokemon in the pokédex that's 60 and 70 less names that everyone has to remember if Pokemon keeps growing which obviously what Sun and Moon we're going to get new Pokemon we're at we're going to go over 723 or whatever we're at right now and that's you know sixty or seven and we have to remember plus the mega evolutions they're going to stick on so I I feel like in the long run what they did now is going to pay off I do not feel like it's a cop-out to bring politics up again in the same episode but I'm realizing that indistinct contrast to my real life politics I'm like a Pokemon hyper conservative I am like a like Ted Cruz's grandfather when it comes to Pokemon I'm like new things no I don't want any of that it's perfect how it is in fact it we should revert to the way it was a generation ago everything was fine but everything was fine until Cynthia got enough office just change in the book are you Ted Cruz's grandfather was actually a hippie yeah I mean I'm all for new stuff in Pokemon I know Travis was one of the people very vocal about not wanting a new type and then who took the Pokemon quiz and got very tight because secretly have fairies are cute fairies are cute very type Ares wear boots I don't like that they added a new type but fairies are adorable Michelle wrightson from Canada she writes hey Steve Travis will and anyone else that might be one on the podcast asking to say hahaha joke about Logan sick burn Logan a heart I'm excited for pokmon go although I'm not trying to give my hope get my host hopes up yeah you want to give them another robbery just destroying the English language tonight Mike Witt well that's every day of my life my question is what do you think will be brought through in in-app purchases I'm hoping pokeballs won't cost real money although there's a good chance they will be thanks for taking the time to read this question love love is all caps love the podcast so much have a fabulous day smiley face ! in app purchases are going to be much like me tomo and it's going to be cute outfits for your trainer to wear your trainer can be a hot dog I I don't think they're gonna go that far with it i I II wouldn't be surprised if they give you like five free pokeballs a day or something like that and then if you need more you want more you have to buy those right and if I think that's I can see it going two ways I could see it like that sort of akin to the other free-to-play games that have been Pokemon related we're like Pokemon shuffle where you have a certain amount that you can play for free and then you pay to continue and they would work that in by giving you a certain number of pokeballs per day or at the other way I could see it going is you can use normal pokeballs for free and excuse me have a smaller chance of catching the Pokemon you find but if you want to guarantee a catch you have to buy a master ball or something like that since we've already seen that they have pokeballs great balls ultra balls and master balls in the game from the little footage we've seen although i doubt i mean i think that's a more optimistic gas because that one it would be completely fun feasible to play that version of the game free to play for as long as you wanted and more likely they would want to push the version where if you only play too casually and only needed the five pokeballs to get your fill then none more power to you but i think that that's the route they would go because most players are probably one more than five so how does the parent lemongrass actually handle money and how do they make money on ingress i'm not sure how ingress makes money I didn't enjoy the game enough to stick with it mmm because they did say like you that the locations that are more popular or like you know monuments and things like that places are more from visited will have a larger collection of items that you'll be able to obtain from those locations so I there's a possibility that there may actually be no in-game transaction and what they're really selling is your location data and their frequent frequency that you know certain locations oh well come on we all know that adage that if you're not paying for something than the thing that's being sold is you so I know I don't care what I live in Washington DC I think they want student estimate that like the citizens of Washington DC are photographed 260 something times a day everyone the government knows where I am definitely I literally have homeland security headquarters in my backyard I'm sure everything I do with my apartment is videoed and recorded anyways I don't care whatever come after me come at me bro you know where I am we'll live in the dream I just have been a surveillance state and I've grown to accept it I I will probably get more information a Pokemon go sooner rather than later here but I would assume that the the master ball will be a very pricey item on the list mmm Jake rights in here he says hello IGN's podcast games cube came sku's game scoop does a 20 question segment with games I was thinking that maybe you guys could do that segment with like pokemon i think it would be fun to listen to thanks love the show Jake a revitalization of extreme speed yeah maybe extremes at nay doesn't obviously say but I don't know if extreme speed fits that mold I haven't listened to games game scoop in a long time it man that used to be one of the I've cast I used to love to listen to only 2000s babies yeah I mean I'm definitely not opposed to doing new segment so I think we fall into this this crutch of a lot of people like the off-topic banner at the beginning of the episode so and and I personally enjoy the off-topic banter I like getting that out of my system I like you know not everything to be so serious I think it's something that a unique that our show does compared to the other Pokemon podcasts that are out there and they come and go quite frequently but as I don't I don't think I hope you're not referring to like I like a top five like what are our top five fairy pokemon or something cuz I don't know how much interest in us making up a you know I don't think that's what the pinion base list would be yeah I mean forbid that we do like a Kalos ten of the ten best pokemon yellow so what I said that would be at a staffy there will first there's a lot of people who voted in that not only editors but the community there was art to go with there was exclusive are to go with that there was move sets a lot that's different than us sitting down before the show cuz gosh forbid we actually talk about what the show is going to be and they like all right we need a top five list for grass pokémon what do you think Rico I don't think that's I don't think that's at all what the person writing that emo was suggesting i think it's a more akin to what we used to do with extreme speed although we sort of retired that segment because we found it to not be very interesting unless you had a new gaston and yet at the same time it felt strange to you say hey person we've hardly talked to you before I'm going to bombard you with questions now yeah I'm 20 questions is a game where like one person thinks of something and then the other people can ask up to 20 questions but they can only be yes or no questions and then they have to at the end guess what the original person was thinking of oh we're talking about like that like the game 20 questions 20 questions yeah that's fun those were the words that were used in the letter that's fair it's like I'm thinking of a Pokemon can you guys guess what pokemon I'm thinking of and then Travis says squishy and i said yes i don't i don't know how i mean i'd i would have to listen to an episode of game scoop to see what like what exactly he's referring to us you're right now oh I was gonna say listeners you know what Steve is willing to put himself through for you he'll listen to an episode of game scoop like that you're like pitching that as a as in like it's torture for that podcast is as good as it was when I did listen to it no you're mistaken because you're thinking of a podcast that's been discontinued it's actually games coop where chickens talk about games that sounds by kind of show sounds better than this show I'll tell you that now Robert P rights in hello SBJ and everyone else I'm one of your biggest fans it's great to listen to you guys talk about Pokemon other games first question is I would love a new type because I've been playing the same types for over 10 years now well I suppose besides fairy and number two this is full circle Travis Elder Scrolls aren't mm mm Oh based like Skyrim and a baby amar they are awesome you should try one of them sometimes see you soon Robert I mean I'm not a fan of I've played both oblivion and Skyrim and i did not enjoy either of them but i like that i would rather play fallout which is very similar just set in a different universe and i enjoy fallout isn't oblivion 10 years old now yes that's cool isn't oblivion based on the D&D rule sets no I wasn't game that's based on the D&D rule sets that is um shoot that's um now it's number one you never neverwinter nights neverwinter nights ya asses um strength intelligence wisdom or intelligent I think there's two I think its strength intelligence wisdom I think it's almost like the D&D stats but they also add luck and I don't think that there's sure I forget that there's weird stats in Oblivion and the previous Elder Scrolls games with on Skyrim gets rid of those for simplicity's sake and I know what I like and I don't like and it's Elder Scrolls does not fall under the list of likes that's so good but I mean teach their own you want to write in send us an email more than happy to read it on air we still have a couple that I have to filter through here but I think we got through a couple today so if you want to email spj at pkmn casscom or just go to poke my podcast calm and hit the contact button either way is acceptable to get an email over to me with that being said let's jump into our pokemon of the week and this week spoke amount of the week just to celebrate the digital distribution is jirachi and rachi is the steel psychic mythical pokemon we don't ah two things first thing is i myself need to get better at separating mythical and legendary pokemon since we've now hit that direction of Rocky's mythical and I think zapdos Articuno Moltres or legendary and yes mythical czar done through distributions only legendaries are can be caught in game is that is that the like a hundred percent defining factor that's the will anderson hundred percent to find a guy actor and if you need anything more than that you're not my friend anymore i see so dried she is the wish pokémon you can get him him or her or now it yeah cuz it is genderless it's correct it is not known to evolve it to have any other pokemon there's not a really good biology about it besides a just describing what jirachi everyone knows her truck she looks like it has a giant star on its head as a creepy eye on its stomach that is actually really cool and it's like a cute flying star Travis will have a move set for it I was going to say I think the concept is based on like some Japanese seasons not only one of shooting stars but the little tags that hang like it has the three little tags that hang off of it oh that's a Japanese custom of writing your wish on to a piece of paper and then sticking it to a like a certain temple area to have your like witches for the new year or whatever I make sense to come true I let's just remember that wishes don't ever come true that's great that's awesome um I have no way to transition from that darkness so let's just jirachi wish maker that that never got hmm well we're here now and we're talking about Jirachi Jirachi is cool because it's one of those pokemon that are in the category of mu and sal abhi and manaphy and Victini and what ones am I missing I think those shaymin Shaymin yep of Pokemon that have 100's all the way down turtles all the way down on their base stats so that's 100 HP 100 attack defense special tax special defense in speed these pokemon i find really fun to build form because you've got the option to go for an offensive sad or a defensive set and you're not too punished for going with either because 100 is a pretty decent stat and these pokemon also tends you have good move pools as is the case with jirachi and Jirachi in addition to that has some pretty great typing in psychic and steel and even better than that a really cool ability and serene grace which doubles the chance of secondary effects to trigger on moose that's things like a percent chance to burn or something like that any any time a move has a something percent chance to do something well that's not true most move because that's but yeah so the moves in the game have coded in them things as primary effects and secondary effects and usually if it's a thing that has a chance to occur it's coated in as a secondary effect and so read grace will double the chance for that to happen so we could build a defensive set and that would be something around toxic and wish but I think it's more fun to do a more offensive set built around trying to flinch your opponent over and over again because we're all awful human beings and we like to frustrate our opponents ceaselessly the best way to do that is to use Ironhead a note about flinch is that it only works if you attack fur is that tres am I remembering that right which only works if you're the if you attack first so we're going to want to make sure you're fast as possible we're going to give you a choice scarf a jolly nature and then v's are going to be 252 and attack and speed and you can throw that additional for an HP well I mean a quick clot would work in that circumstance to iron hat is going to be your main move there you're going to the most as it's got on its own a thirty percent chance to flinch which is already ridiculous add on to that that the the base power isn't too bad either at maybe that's correct at eighty-four percent accuracy means means that iron head is pretty great however you don't always want to be using a steel-type move in case you're up against something that resists it so for a little coverage that still allows you to flinch your opponent I'm going to recommend this I'm head but a lot of people run a heart stamp over some head but because heart stamp has higher accuracy and a higher chance to flinch but I think that if you're by the way I see it if you're running a choice scarf and we are you don't want to be locked into a move and I would rather be locked into a move that has a higher base power in this instance because I feel like it's it's easier for your opponent to just switch into something that resists heart stamp and you can just take as many hard stamps as it takes until you that your opponent doesn't flinch and then you respond in in tune so that would basically forced you to switch out whereas if you rands and headbutt sure you might miss one out of ten times and you're less likely to flinch with it you're at least dealing enough damage that you don't feel like it's a waste of a move to lock yourself into I guess it's personal preference but that's where I lean u-turns great just because it allows you to run a choice scarf Pokemon and not feel like your options are limited because you can you turn out and if they switch you get a very cool advantage there because you can pick a Pokemon that counters it well and then finally healing wish is a really cool move as if for some reason you end up switching out when josh is low on HP it's getting to the end of the end of the match and it's and you get a free switching with jirachi but it's not really going to be able to do anything against your opponent's pokemon what you can do is just use healing wish that's a move that Kos jirachi and heels another Pokemon as long as it's not ko'd fully removing all status effects as well so you could make jirachi which might be useless in some circumstances where everything resists it or for whatever reason the opponent has things that are very susceptible to the flinching strategy you can just use healing wish and bring back a Pokemon that is more useful but doesn't have much health to being very useful so that's our set I think I went over all of it it's pretty close to things a lot of people run for jirachi but with that personal preference of done had but over heart stamp in there too so jirachi is fun and do a lot of cool things with it I got bit of trivia here for jirachi it is the lightest steel type pokémon weighing only 2.4 American pounds jirachi was the first pope his life Pokemon to be distributed via the nintendo Wi-Fi connection previously only event really yeah only event items needed to obtain Pokemon that had been distributed during Wi-Fi so you needed like an item in the game oh I think I actually participate in that desert distribution you see a fat jirachi that special special jirachi and some cartridge someone yeah you don't happen Pokemon bank where it can be kept safe forever I don't I don't have pokemon bank yeah five dollars a year Travis yeah I know I i deduct well I don't really get a lot of enjoyment out of playing the games with pokemon I caught in previous games I like the experience of starting from scratch even to the point of getting a good set of Pokemon for breeding I like doing that from scratch too when I you know and it's only like every other generation that I really feel like oh I'm gonna get into EV training this generation or breeding but um you you better know our Ted Cruz's grandfather you're like oh back in my day we didn't have these carryover Pokemon from the pokemon bank we had to go out in the field and catch all-new Pokemon every time we wanted to have a Pokemon party pull us up by our oh there's no pokemon that sounds like bootstraps that I can make a pun out of I'm sure there is use I think of it for soup exactly that's Russia is the only generation through Pokemon that cannot be obtained in any Hoenn based games without an event cool yeah today I jirachi is the only generation three legendary / mythical Pokemon that is not featured in any of the pokemon ranger games wow that's a loss for pokemon ranger I'll make the cut although George jirachi is genderless in the main games it is referred to as a male in Pokemon super mystery dungeon oh so boepd of jirachi wants to be a mail drop she can be a male I agree settle down super mystery dungeon the game that Travis bought and employ and anyways Chen you got me except that was came from the stone ages genders out of date despite being the despite being legitimately legitimately obtainable in earlier games Chinese jirachi were previously locked out of generation sixes Wi-Fi feature prior and update this makes jirachi the only pokemon to undergo this kind of issue you cannot transfer tiny jirachi 'he's via the Wi-Fi it was it so if I'm understanding correctly there was some distribution where you could get a shiny jirachi yeah I freaked sense forgot about that distribution and said oh yeah there's no way you could get a shiny jirachi and said if you get if you hack yourself a shiny jirachi you can't trade it but they forgot that people have it legitimately am i understanding that correctly yeah are correct hey let's awesome think that was a Korean giveaway maybe it'd be interesting not to get off topic if there were there were pokemon that could only be trade traded locally I know that would be interesting like people were probably cringing at that the audio of like why would you ever want or suggest that but what pokemon already has a problem of like I'll just orangey it I'll just gameshark it I'll just have whatever kind of hack you can do and it destroys the Pokemon economy if you believe in that or whatever but like I thought the viv vivillon vivillon vivillon I don't know yes vivio like the fact that you could only get the patterns and different regions was really cool me too and like when you have to trade a hunter or a Kadabra to evolve like that's really cool yeah so it's just like another like it's hard for a Pokemon to be rare when somebody could just hack 30 of them and then just put them up on the trading the BTS or whatever and just hand them out what if this is going against my Pokemon ultra conservatism ah what if and I I don't think this would actually work out but what if they made it so that instead of using and this also gets into wills acceptance of the surveillance state in which he lives instead of using a combination of your trainer named all of that stuff and then the time and date to determine the random elements of a Pokemon to determine its Ivy's when you encounter in the wild or when you hatch it what if they used your geographic location as the seed for the randomness so if you wanted to orangey a pokemon it's not that you would have to like set your clock timer to a certain thing you would have to get on a plane and go to the exact barren wasteland in the middle of Nebraska and then Hatcher get your gibble so that you could get the perfect Garchomp I think that solves all of our problems I mean this is what who's with me it's me but if you look at like Pokemon shuffle like you have the obvious thing that it's doing which is authenticating before you walk in connecting to the internet and so when you catch pokemon there you know that you've caught them and you didn't obtain them in any other way besides the way that you did to earn them and so if they're running a promotion we're like farfetch is only available this week and if you don't catch farfetch in this week because you you're just bad up shuffle because farfetch is pretty easy to catch you have to wait till he comes and that makes you a perfect just being an example that makes you excited that like oh my god fire freshers coming back this week like now I can get them or in retro only like the other way is like oh my god this event ends in two days and I still haven't caught farfetch like that's what I need to do before the event ends like it adds that sense of urgency or like that sense of like I want this and right now I feel like the current pokemon games don't have that and for drat you for me for saying what you're saying is you're not even gonna consider my dia my idea of random number GE 0 narration no no I think I think that's cool I think I think anything I mean it goes back to the problem we're like once somebody figures out what the rng is they just aren't you it and then you you get it you get problems we're like you know no pokemon are special because I'll just orangey a perfect IV like why would I do it any other way this is the way to get a perfect Pokemon and it like no shinies are really that rare shiny hunting is very popular and like you see a bunch of twitch streamers do it and it's and they get enjoyment out of it and that's cool and like I think shinies as a concept or really cool but when you can just orange yourself a shiny or just heck yourself a shiny it it almost like it destroys everyone else's enjoyment in some aspect and maybe not directly or what nap but that's why I brought up shuffle is like once a pokemon game authenticates to the internet prior to you logging in not saying that's going to happen or but I am saying that should happen you get rid of the ability for people to orangey that stuff or try to game the system and at the end of the day what that means to me or what I want is for that like environment to feel it felt in red and blue we're both besides before people figured out missingno and everything but like excited to find a pokemon or this shiny is actually rare or this pokemon with great IVs was special because you found it or you pre did it or or something along I'm rambling but I think you guys get the what I was gonna say cool story bro but you know Pokemon shuffles been hacked yeah i mean everything can that does it I mean you could say the same thing about like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 or destiny or anything like that like going to destiny like when you get a an exotic gun like that gun is exotic there's no other way to get it besides the way besides how the orange II worked or besides you doing the missions and the stories to get up to that point to get it or and that quote that feels cool that feels like you were collecting something in there's no real way to game the system so when you get it you get it and that feels great now I agree I agree I'm in with the shiny hunters I know quite a few people who are shiny hunters and they're quite dedicated to the craft yeah like I I have never yet seen a shiny in the wild and so like wow I know when I do find one hopefully we'll be in sun and moon like that that i will probably connect with that pokemon in like I mean it could be a Pokemon I hate or not not hate but like don't like like a geodude or something like I have zero attachment to Geodude I don't really care he exists whatever but if I like found a shiny one like that would probably mean a lot more to me and somebody could be like oh I'll just trade you a shiny and that's like that's not the same thing now I know so you feel like you'll have a deep romantic relationship with a shiny pokemon yes yeah you know and go on a giant journey of Dungeons and Dragons well I think I think that's our show I just want people to know that I'm not act that I I want to reiterate that my ultra conservatism only exists in relation to Pokemon and that's not at all how I am the real I want to reiterate i am not actually Ted Cruz's grandfather I am not actually yeah I won't get into that mean that's probably not PG for this show never mom keep going uh yeah so I think that wraps up our show if you're listening to this before friday which i mean yet 24 well yeah like 48 hours because i'll get this published tonight I will be at the Midwest gaming classic in brookfield Wisconsin for a saturday and sunday i think the weekend ticket is like 60 bucks we'll have to we use hooked up to each other via an ethernet cord this ancient piece of technology that carries internet across where we're going to try some local play pokin which is really cool out of the pokemon arcade machine that i built for pinball that'll be there we have poem on stadium 2 and some pokemon snap set up as well and have some leftover t-shirts and everything that i'll be selling for probably like a dollar I'm just to this point just get rid of them we want a dollar t-shirt might be worth trucking out tuberculous concen well technically it be a 61 dollar t-shirt but still worth every every penny every penny other than that I haven't said this in a while but if if you like the show if you made it this far if you look forward to us every week leave us a review in itunes because that actually helps a lot it helps other people find the show easier it helps itunes recognize us as you know what we as a podcast so even if you don't have itunes it takes just like two or three minutes to open it update it because it probably needs to be updated because it's itunes and then go in there and leave us a review it seriously helps us out and if you like to show you made of this far would appreciate that if you're listening to our other podcasts dungeons and dragon nights we've been doing that live every tuesday night on twitch travis myself Logan Greg and Jeff I think we just finished episode 6 last night purpose that sounds right yeah so we're about halfway through the season there will pry so if you're not caught up that's in itunes it's also on youtube youtube.com / p cam and cast and then like I said it's and also catch on twitch on Tuesday nights and that's been very popular the chat that hangs out with us on tuesday night very awesome and i've been streaming pokin every thursday nights so if you want to hang out and play pokin on twitch twitch TV / pkmn cast and we do that at 8 p.m. central time so that's always
