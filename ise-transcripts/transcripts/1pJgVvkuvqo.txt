you can ever ask me how my weekend went (0:45 - 0:49)
it's because when i (0:47 - 0:52)
in the history of this show when i (0:49 - 0:54)

like something's happening right that's (0:54 - 0:59)

this program (1:07 - 1:10)
i have started playing call of duty what (1:10 - 1:14)
why (1:13 - 1:17)
because it's fun (1:14 - 1:17)
i've never felt so betrayed in my life i (1:18 - 1:22)
i realized that (1:21 - 1:25)
it was a spur of the moment kind of who (1:22 - 1:27)
who brought you to this doorstep what do (1:25 - 1:28)
you think (1:27 - 1:31)
that's it that relationship is over you (1:28 - 1:34)
can't have my relationship (1:31 - 1:38)
i am ending it did the call of duty (1:34 - 1:41)
involve a refer-a-friend program no (1:38 - 1:43)
oh okay that was going to be a (1:41 - 1:44)
transition until (1:43 - 1:49)
it is it is on discount (1:44 - 1:52)
so that's like a referral friend pro (1:49 - 1:55)
sure yes a friend of mine (1:52 - 1:59)
referred me to this game (1:55 - 2:03)
okay uh we have some pokemon news (1:59 - 2:06)

today so (2:20 - 2:25)
not a terribly busy week (2:21 - 2:28)
but hey sometimes we take those (2:25 - 2:30)
sometimes it's okay (2:28 - 2:34)
for the 25th anniversary (2:30 - 2:34)
there's a huge gap of nothing happening (2:34 - 2:38)
there should be something happening (2:36 - 2:40)
every week they should be capitalizing (2:38 - 2:43)
on 25 years (2:40 - 2:46)
pumping out the content get get it (2:43 - 2:48)
out there they're building the suspense (2:46 - 2:50)
is what they're doing a bts song out (2:48 - 2:51)
there (2:50 - 2:54)
you make us never forget this was 25 (2:51 - 2:55)
years (2:54 - 2:59)
uh sure let's (2:55 - 2:59)
let's uh start off with the pokemon go (3:00 - 3:03)
news (3:02 - 3:05)
uh this episode specifically with the (3:03 - 3:07)
invite your friends to enjoy pokemon go (3:05 - 3:10)
and earn rewards (3:07 - 3:11)
this is off pokemon go live.com this is (3:10 - 3:14)
niantic's official (3:11 - 3:16)
news website uh we are excited to (3:14 - 3:18)
announce a referral program coming soon (3:16 - 3:19)
to pokemon go (3:18 - 3:20)
i think uh if you're australian you're (3:19 - 3:22)
able to use it (3:20 - 3:25)
i saw that yes the beta testing country (3:22 - 3:26)
that is australia (3:25 - 3:29)
when you refer a friend uh to enjoy go (3:26 - 3:30)
whether it's their first time playing or (3:29 - 3:32)
returning after a break they'll receive (3:30 - 3:34)
rewards like pokemon encounters (3:32 - 3:37)
rare candy incubators and more as they (3:34 - 3:39)
hit milestones on their adventure and so (3:37 - 3:39)
will you (3:39 - 3:41)
like other features we've launched in (3:39 - 3:43)
the path past (3:41 - 3:45)
we will be turning the referral program (3:43 - 3:47)
over in time in order to make the (3:45 - 3:48)
process as (3:47 - 3:49)
exciting as possible trainers in (3:48 - 3:52)
australia will be the first to try it (3:49 - 3:54)
uh we hope you enjoy playing pogo (3:52 - 3:56)
together and then it shows a picture of (3:54 - 3:57)
uh (3:56 - 3:59)
like a new trainer with a charmander and (3:57 - 4:02)
then another trainer with a charizard (3:59 - 4:05)
it's a very cute picture (4:02 - 4:05)
so how do we feel about a referral (4:06 - 4:11)
program (4:10 - 4:14)
four and a half years into a game i mean (4:11 - 4:14)
that is (4:14 - 4:16)
generally when they're like ooh we're (4:14 - 4:19)
not getting new players now it's time to (4:16 - 4:22)
ratchet up somehow to also (4:19 - 4:25)
let's start mining like bring people (4:22 - 4:29)
back into the cult right we've had some (4:25 - 4:31)
some losses some people have have (4:29 - 4:32)
strayed (4:31 - 4:35)
from the pack and we need to get them (4:32 - 4:36)
rein them back in (4:35 - 4:39)
let's offer them some meager rewards i (4:36 - 4:43)
literally can't think of a person (4:39 - 4:46)
that i know that i could convince to (4:43 - 4:47)
play pokemon go that (4:46 - 4:50)
isn't already playing pokemon go yeah (4:47 - 4:52)
that seemed to be the (4:50 - 4:55)
general consensus was (4:52 - 4:57)
i have no one to invite playing the game (4:55 - 4:58)
uh (4:57 - 5:01)
that i that i saw but so (4:58 - 5:02)
you guys are just thinking of new people (5:01 - 5:05)
what about people who (5:02 - 5:07)
have been idle who haven't been playing (5:05 - 5:09)
for a while yeah it doesn't say that (5:07 - 5:11)
in this press release but i think the (5:09 - 5:14)
self road when they data mined this (5:11 - 5:16)
said that if the person didn't play for (5:14 - 5:18)
over 12 months or something they would (5:16 - 5:22)
be able to be referred but i was going (5:18 - 5:22)
to say (5:22 - 5:25)
you know i stream pokemon every day on (5:22 - 5:26)
twitch (5:25 - 5:28)
and it there's a shocking amount of (5:26 - 5:29)
people that (5:28 - 5:32)
just don't play go they either (5:29 - 5:34)
didn't have a phone at the time when it (5:32 - 5:36)
came out which (5:34 - 5:38)
like when go really came out if you (5:36 - 5:39)
didn't have a smartphone to play it you (5:38 - 5:41)
kind of missed out on that whole craze (5:39 - 5:42)
and then (5:41 - 5:44)
it died down of course and then you're (5:42 - 5:46)
like oh well i missed it (5:44 - 5:49)
um or they just didn't try it at all (5:46 - 5:50)
when it came out so i think (5:49 - 5:52)
i think there's i think there's still (5:50 - 5:56)
plenty of people that you can get (5:52 - 5:59)
uh i am sure there is like for example i (5:56 - 6:00)
i have no clue (5:59 - 6:04)
not that i like my brother but (6:00 - 6:07)
at one point i'm sure he liked pokemon (6:04 - 6:09)
because he i know he played the games (6:07 - 6:11)
but if i if i did like my brother and he (6:09 - 6:12)
hasn't started playing there'd be a (6:11 - 6:14)
thing of like hey you should sign up (6:12 - 6:16)
i bring up my brother because this is (6:14 - 6:17)
this is this is (6:16 - 6:20)
niantic isn't missing the mark on this (6:17 - 6:21)
lots of games (6:20 - 6:23)
enter a referral friend program many (6:21 - 6:25)
years in so it's not like (6:23 - 6:28)
they're tone deaf all the time yeah um (6:25 - 6:32)
but like uh destiny had a referral front (6:28 - 6:32)
program (6:32 - 6:35)
three years into destiny and i was able (6:32 - 6:35)
to get (6:35 - 6:37)
a handful of people to play destiny for (6:35 - 6:39)
the first time because the rewards were (6:37 - 6:40)
good and (6:39 - 6:41)
you know as somebody who was very (6:40 - 6:43)
addicted to destiny i was like oh please (6:41 - 6:44)
please i want (6:43 - 6:46)
because you got exclusive rewards as the (6:44 - 6:49)
person who referred (6:46 - 6:51)
um so i i think this is fine i'd be (6:49 - 6:54)
curious what (6:51 - 6:54)
how good the rewards become after (6:54 - 6:59)
they're done beta testing australia (6:56 - 7:02)
yeah i will say that in classic (6:59 - 7:06)
niantic pokemon go fashion their timing (7:02 - 7:06)
on this (7:06 - 7:11)
is completely off (7:06 - 7:11)
because literally (7:12 - 7:15)
i could have referred your wife (7:15 - 7:23)
and gotten a bunch of prizes because she (7:19 - 7:24)
hasn't touched pokemon go (7:23 - 7:28)
in forever except for the kanto tour (7:24 - 7:30)
which happened last month and wrecked (7:28 - 7:32)
all these people who are like i haven't (7:30 - 7:34)
touched go in years but man i can (7:32 - 7:37)
i can 151 it and get back in well now (7:34 - 7:39)
all those people are wiped out (7:37 - 7:42)
no no longer options for me my wife's an (7:39 - 7:43)
interesting go player (7:42 - 7:45)
she there's plenty of pokemon only plays (7:43 - 7:47)
when you make her (7:45 - 7:50)
that's not true i could have a built-in (7:47 - 7:53)
my husband used to play i could probably (7:50 - 7:54)
refer him there you go (7:53 - 7:57)
you're lucky i'm the only single person (7:54 - 7:57)
in this (7:57 - 8:00)
program no see irene doesn't (7:57 - 8:02)
irene will open go she'll play go she'll (8:00 - 8:04)
catch certain pokemon if it's like an (8:02 - 8:06)
oshawott a banary (8:04 - 8:07)
uh you know she's all about catching (8:06 - 8:09)
those or tapping on those but if it's (8:07 - 8:10)
like (8:09 - 8:13)
a bar boat even if she doesn't have it (8:10 - 8:14)
for the decks she's like i'm not (8:13 - 8:15)
catching that i (8:14 - 8:18)
have no like selective she has choices (8:15 - 8:20)

uh trainers niantic's mission is to (11:35 - 11:39)
inspire people to explore the world (11:37 - 11:39)
together (11:39 - 11:41)
i do like exploring the world hopefully (11:39 - 11:43)
that will be a possibility by the end of (11:41 - 11:43)
this year (11:43 - 11:47)
together uh together i can take or leave (11:43 - 11:51)
the world over the past few years we (11:47 - 11:52)
have provided opportunities for people (11:51 - 11:54)
to visit the toh (11:52 - 11:58)
tohoku tohoku region (11:54 - 12:00)
through ingress and pokemon go hey (11:58 - 12:04)

uh now in re remembrance of the great (12:04 - 12:07)
east (12:06 - 12:09)
japan earthquake 10 years ago we are (12:07 - 12:10)
recreating (12:09 - 12:13)
the rediscovery memories and local (12:10 - 12:15)
business of the tohoku (12:13 - 12:17)
program with local government and (12:15 - 12:19)
institutes of awate (12:17 - 12:21)
uh and then a bunch of other japanese (12:19 - 12:23)
cities i will try not to butcher here (12:21 - 12:24)
miyagi and (12:23 - 12:27)
fukushima prefectures this program will (12:24 - 12:29)
benefit 100 stone owner (12:27 - 12:33)
stone store owners in each pre-fixture (12:29 - 12:36)
for six months at no charge and (12:33 - 12:37)
encourage the local communities to (12:36 - 12:39)
explore their hometowns and support (12:37 - 12:40)
businesses there (12:39 - 12:44)
prefecture pre prefecture prefecture (12:40 - 12:46)
there's no i in there it wasn't you know (12:44 - 12:47)
prefecture (12:46 - 12:51)
it's probably not actually a word (12:47 - 12:51)
correct (12:51 - 12:56)
maybe not it could be (12:52 - 12:58)
no no i mean what do you call the hole (12:56 - 12:59)
you break in the wall before you put the (12:58 - 13:01)
fixture in (12:59 - 13:05)
that's a that's a pre-free (13:01 - 13:09)
fixture a pre-fixture (13:05 - 13:12)
you are now becoming like the person who (13:09 - 13:14)
will remain nameless who said to me that (13:12 - 13:15)
the (13:14 - 13:19)
star wars character's name was see (13:15 - 13:22)
what did he said c3 po (13:19 - 13:25)
and i was like you are a (13:22 - 13:28)
a crime of language (13:25 - 13:33)
on the wrong syllable his name is c3bo (13:28 - 13:36)
c three p o c p three o (13:33 - 13:39)
no go away go away go away you're even (13:36 - 13:40)
worse (13:39 - 13:42)
do not do not get me started on star (13:40 - 13:44)
wars i'm gonna call the little mermaid (13:42 - 13:48)
witch ladies c-3po (13:44 - 13:52)
is that correct greg yes yes it's c-3po (13:48 - 13:56)
i am just as star wars as greg (13:52 - 13:58)
if only two years off i was there for (13:56 - 13:59)
the premiere (13:58 - 14:01)
but it's more my brand than yours your (13:59 - 14:04)
brand is skateboarding and looking cool (14:01 - 14:06)
my brand is nerdy star wars crap looking (14:04 - 14:10)
cool it's a bit debatable (14:06 - 14:10)
uh this this uh press release is is (14:10 - 14:14)
pretty long but it is it is cool (14:13 - 14:18)
it is cool that niantic is um supporting (14:14 - 14:21)
so basically this is so march 11th what (14:18 - 14:23)
i believe is the anniversary of the big (14:21 - 14:26)
earthquake and uh was that also the (14:23 - 14:27)
tsunami (14:26 - 14:31)
yes yeah they go hand in hand um (14:27 - 14:34)
and because we we we (14:31 - 14:36)
raised money for that back in the day (14:34 - 14:37)
that was like our first charity on the (14:36 - 14:38)
podcast we ever did (14:37 - 14:40)
i think we i mean we were pretty small (14:38 - 14:41)
we raised like 100 bucks but (14:40 - 14:45)
still better than zero um (14:41 - 14:47)
but so the the intent is to get people (14:45 - 14:49)
to like visit the downtowns (14:47 - 14:51)
of the areas that were affected a decade (14:49 - 14:52)
ago is that (14:51 - 14:54)
like yeah yeah what the goal of the (14:52 - 14:57)
program is okay (14:54 - 14:57)
i will book my flight now pokemon go you (14:58 - 15:02)
have inspired me (15:01 - 15:06)
i need to get a passport oh dagnabbit (15:02 - 15:07)
yeah it's my (15:06 - 15:08)
location's still sitting there on the (15:07 - 15:11)
floor i know i have one let's make it (15:08 - 15:12)
into mexico and canada that's part of my (15:11 - 15:14)
new driver's license but (15:12 - 15:15)
i don't think this should be a minnesota (15:14 - 15:16)
thing (15:15 - 15:19)
[Laughter] (15:16 - 15:21)
we don't have that on the east coast (15:19 - 15:24)
don't don't tell them about it (15:21 - 15:24)
uh final bit of pokemon go news here is (15:25 - 15:29)
pokemon go (15:28 - 15:32)
now shows possible content of its loot (15:29 - 15:33)
box (15:32 - 15:37)
style eggs uh i think this is also (15:33 - 15:40)
did this go live for everyone i remember (15:37 - 15:41)
it was like a slow rollout i know (15:40 - 15:42)
australia got it first (15:41 - 15:46)
of course they did i haven't looked (15:42 - 15:47)
so if i look at my egg it's supposed to (15:46 - 15:49)
tell me what could be in there yeah why (15:47 - 15:52)
yeah yeah hatch eggs every day what are (15:49 - 15:54)
you talking about (15:52 - 15:56)
this is get around you tap on yeah (15:54 - 15:58)
mine's not live yet (15:56 - 16:00)
oh yeah i got nothing for for my eggs (15:58 - 16:02)
here you mean i actually have to like (16:00 - 16:04)
pay attention to what's going on in the (16:02 - 16:04)
game (16:04 - 16:08)
no no you don't have to um so when you (16:04 - 16:08)
tap (16:08 - 16:10)
on an egg it says clicking on an egg tap (16:08 - 16:12)
on an egg (16:10 - 16:15)
it will show the table of contents which (16:12 - 16:15)
differ between (16:15 - 16:17)
egg types and regularly change as the (16:15 - 16:20)
game cycles through a specific pokemon (16:17 - 16:22)
how likely you are in the position of (16:20 - 16:24)
five rarities level one (16:22 - 16:26)
that uh by having one egg symbol appears (16:24 - 16:28)
to be the most common and the (16:26 - 16:32)
five being the most rare (16:28 - 16:33)
will have so if a pokemon has five eggs (16:32 - 16:35)
that means it's the most rare (16:33 - 16:38)
no probability listed no suggestions on (16:35 - 16:39)
how much rarer one (16:38 - 16:42)
is but you at least see what could (16:39 - 16:44)
possibly be in the egg so in the example (16:42 - 16:46)
here it has (16:44 - 16:48)
one egg is a geodude and then the two (16:46 - 16:50)
eggs so these are slightly more rare (16:48 - 16:51)
than geodude would be (16:50 - 16:55)
meowth stun fisk uh sandshrew (16:51 - 16:58)
diglett me the other meowth uh grimer (16:55 - 17:01)
farfetch and then ponyta and then (16:58 - 17:03)
alolan vulpix would be more rare than (17:01 - 17:05)
that oh so what one's meowth and the (17:03 - 17:06)
other meowth (17:05 - 17:09)
one is alolan vulpix okay (17:06 - 17:12)
and then uh galleria and zigzagoon is (17:09 - 17:14)
four out of five which means it's more (17:12 - 17:15)
rare than those and then the (17:14 - 17:17)
the rarest one here i can't what is in (17:15 - 17:19)
this picture what is it oh (17:17 - 17:21)
five out of five would be the galerion (17:19 - 17:22)
dharamaka which is the (17:21 - 17:27)
ice type one we have to talk about this (17:22 - 17:30)
so i have yeah i don't have this at all (17:27 - 17:31)
in my game i have (17:30 - 17:33)
i don't have it but i do have a glare in (17:31 - 17:34)
dara maca hold on (17:33 - 17:38)
i have six eggs that are from minnesota (17:34 - 17:42)
that when i click on them don't have it (17:38 - 17:45)
i have one 7k egg that i got from a gift (17:42 - 17:48)
in new york oh it's probably when your (17:45 - 17:49)
newer eggs have it (17:48 - 17:53)
and that one has it no it can't be (17:49 - 17:54)
because i got (17:53 - 17:58)
this new york egg is older oh (17:54 - 17:59)
yeah because i haven't hatched an egg in (17:58 - 18:01)
like the last week yeah i have a (17:59 - 18:05)
march 8th 2021 from royal palm beach wow (18:01 - 18:06)
that sounds like a fancy place royal (18:05 - 18:08)
palm beach florida (18:06 - 18:11)
and it doesn't have it (18:08 - 18:11)
no but this one is from march and the (18:11 - 18:15)
other ones are (18:14 - 18:18)
from february so (18:15 - 18:18)
isn't it amazing place names i have one (18:19 - 18:23)
from from royal palm beach florida and (18:21 - 18:25)
i'm like wow what an incredibly fancy (18:23 - 18:26)
incredible place that must be and then (18:25 - 18:28)
the next one right next to it is from (18:26 - 18:30)
south elgin illinois and that just (18:28 - 18:32)
sounds like where the like the sewage (18:30 - 18:33)
treatment plant is (18:32 - 18:36)
i mean that's not a great area i have (18:33 - 18:37)
one from canada that's (18:36 - 18:39)
that has to be fancy it's probably a (18:37 - 18:40)
stantler right (18:39 - 18:44)
yeah yeah i got a bunch of (18:40 - 18:46)
but do you have anything so it must be (18:44 - 18:47)
march (18:46 - 18:50)
eggs that are showing them and not (18:47 - 18:51)
mm-hmm (18:50 - 18:54)
palm beach is from march so yeah they (18:51 - 18:55)
said (18:54 - 18:58)
march eggs march but i that (18:55 - 19:00)
it doesn't have it that's what i'm (18:58 - 19:02)
saying oh i see what you're saying (19:00 - 19:05)
but mine does weird (19:02 - 19:08)
uh niantic tweeted on march 11 saying (19:05 - 19:09)
trainers were excited to share that (19:08 - 19:11)
we're testing where a limited number of (19:09 - 19:12)
trainers will be able to see pokemon (19:11 - 19:13)
hatch in their inventory (19:12 - 19:15)
trainers will be able to test by tapping (19:13 - 19:17)
on an egg to see the list of possible (19:15 - 19:18)
pokemon and rarity (19:17 - 19:20)
please note uh this will not show if (19:18 - 19:22)
pokemon may be shiny (19:20 - 19:25)
i like how they had to include that (19:22 - 19:28)
i'm sure people were asking (19:25 - 19:28)
um yeah this is this is fine there's (19:29 - 19:36)
like this pokemon go is like the last (19:34 - 19:38)
pokemon mobile game to reveal (19:36 - 19:41)
odds because pokemon duel had odds and (19:38 - 19:42)
pokemon masters (19:41 - 19:44)
has like you can tap on it you can see (19:42 - 19:45)
leon is a one percent or (19:44 - 19:49)
um you know elisa or lisa is like a two (19:45 - 19:49)
percent (19:49 - 19:52)
so pokemon masters is very much (19:49 - 19:54)
very forward about the odds but pokemon (19:52 - 19:56)
masters is also a loot based (19:54 - 20:00)
game i do think the eggs are also (19:56 - 20:02)
loot based but you could make the (20:00 - 20:04)
argument (20:02 - 20:06)
that which i'm sure is the argument (20:04 - 20:08)
niantic makes i'm not saying it's a good (20:06 - 20:10)
argument but it is an argument (20:08 - 20:13)
where the egg is already determined once (20:10 - 20:14)
you get it you're not (20:13 - 20:16)
rolling for anything else you're just (20:14 - 20:17)
using a key (20:16 - 20:22)
which is the incubator to open it (20:17 - 20:23)
which i think is what counter strike (20:22 - 20:26)
does i think you use you buy (20:23 - 20:29)
keys to open boxes what is counter (20:26 - 20:31)
strike (20:29 - 20:33)
it's like the call of duty but for good (20:31 - 20:35)
people (20:33 - 20:38)
oh so i'm a bad people now i don't know (20:35 - 20:39)
i already said it at the time of the (20:38 - 20:39)
show (20:39 - 20:43)
it's not it's like it's november um (20:39 - 20:47)
i mean that's a real it's real week but (20:43 - 20:48)
sure i (20:47 - 20:51)
mean i don't think it holds up once the (20:48 - 20:51)
uk (20:51 - 20:54)
does something but i don't know this (20:51 - 20:56)
because the the whole reason that (20:54 - 20:58)
loot boxes need to be disclosed now is (20:56 - 21:00)
because of uk laws not (20:58 - 21:02)
u.s laws well and i'm i'm sure there's (21:00 - 21:03)
somebody out there (21:02 - 21:07)
who could make the argument that um (21:03 - 21:10)
i have to pay for incubators to hatch (21:07 - 21:11)
these eggs (21:10 - 21:13)
so you have to tell me what the chances (21:11 - 21:14)
are of getting a good one so i don't (21:13 - 21:16)
waste my paid for (21:14 - 21:19)
incubators on not (21:16 - 21:22)
good chances eggs it's like transition (21:19 - 21:23)
of fungibility of the (21:22 - 21:27)
money i'm just curious if this (21:23 - 21:30)
egg system of like the five to one is (21:27 - 21:32)
good enough for what the uk law is (21:30 - 21:33)
asking for (21:32 - 21:37)
i mean that's odds i mean it's odds (21:33 - 21:37)
yeah but we don't know how like what (21:38 - 21:41)
what does five out of five mean for (21:40 - 21:43)
daramaku we don't know if that's a one (21:41 - 21:44)
percent (21:43 - 21:47)
i'm sure that's published somewhere it's (21:44 - 21:49)
hidden in the terms and conditions that (21:47 - 21:51)
nobody reads (21:49 - 21:51)
yeah okay (21:57 - 22:02)
um last thing (21:59 - 22:06)
uh before we take a break here is (22:02 - 22:10)
the i wanted to give a tcg update (22:06 - 22:13)
the mcdonald's pikachu card (22:10 - 22:16)
it's worth five million dollars now no (22:13 - 22:17)
um (22:16 - 22:19)
so when it initially came out it was (22:17 - 22:20)
worth about eighty dollars (22:19 - 22:22)
i was watching a couple auctions before (22:20 - 22:24)
the start of stream (22:22 - 22:27)
this one ended literally 15 minutes ago (22:24 - 22:28)
uh and it (22:27 - 22:31)
the winning bid was 40 with free (22:28 - 22:32)
shipping (22:31 - 22:34)
um so it looks like it's it's dropped in (22:32 - 22:36)
price by half (22:34 - 22:38)
i don't know at this point because i (22:36 - 22:39)
haven't been to a mcdonald's in a while (22:38 - 22:43)
spoiler um i don't know if (22:39 - 22:46)
does mcdonald's still have these cards i (22:43 - 22:47)
don't know (22:46 - 22:49)
you're literally asking the wrong person (22:47 - 22:52)
yeah i don't know if um (22:49 - 22:55)
now the eyes are limited yeah i mean (22:52 - 22:56)
once they run out they run out but i'm (22:55 - 22:57)
curious if (22:56 - 23:00)
because they were restricting you must (22:57 - 23:02)
buy a happy meal to get a card well (23:00 - 23:03)
depending on your mcdonald's because (23:02 - 23:06)
every mcdonald's is different um (23:03 - 23:08)
i wonder if that kept more in stock and (23:06 - 23:09)
if now they're at a point where they (23:08 - 23:12)
just don't care anymore of like okay (23:09 - 23:14)
we don't have scalpers driving up every (23:12 - 23:15)
day so if you want some (23:14 - 23:18)
happy meals here's some happy meals i (23:15 - 23:19)
should test that i should go to (23:18 - 23:22)
mcdonald's this week and see if i can (23:19 - 23:25)
so from what i had understood from the (23:22 - 23:27)
internet and i'm (23:25 - 23:31)
very much a cursory observer of the (23:27 - 23:33)
internet i am i am not wholeheartedly (23:31 - 23:34)
invested (23:33 - 23:37)
in that particular technology um (23:34 - 23:40)
i had heard that people have moved on (23:37 - 23:42)
from happy meals (23:40 - 23:45)
to cereal boxes yes they've been tearing (23:42 - 23:46)
up in cereal boxes (23:45 - 23:49)

minneapolis biased here (25:46 - 25:51)
look there's the real the real concern (25:48 - 25:55)
and now conspiracy that i (25:51 - 25:57)
have uncovered in researching this (25:55 - 25:58)
particular topic (25:57 - 26:01)
i have gone to the general mills website (25:58 - 26:02)
to find out (26:01 - 26:04)
what are the general mills serials (26:02 - 26:05)
especially because i wanted to find out (26:04 - 26:05)
if (26:05 - 26:08)
coco puffs because they did use the goku (26:05 - 26:09)
for blah blah blah (26:08 - 26:13)
they did say that yeah okay so (26:09 - 26:15)
they have a list of the cereals that (26:13 - 26:18)
they produce (26:15 - 26:18)
it does not include cocoa puffs (26:18 - 26:26)
it does not include reese's puffs (26:22 - 26:26)
but it does include a cereal i've never (26:26 - 26:31)
heard of called cascadian farm (26:28 - 26:35)
where are you looking general mills.com (26:31 - 26:39)
what's weird is they they released a (26:35 - 26:42)
pokemon cereal it just says pokemon in (26:39 - 26:43)
big letters it's a red box there's (26:42 - 26:46)
pikachu on it and then in very small (26:43 - 26:47)
font it's called like (26:46 - 26:50)
berry burst i think so the cereal is (26:47 - 26:52)
called berry burst or something like (26:50 - 26:54)
that berry explosion i don't know (26:52 - 26:56)
but there's no cards in that well (26:54 - 26:58)
because it's not a general meal cereal (26:56 - 27:02)
yeah but they put a cereal on shelf (26:58 - 27:04)
i bought said cereal i have not tried it (27:02 - 27:06)
yet it looks like (27:04 - 27:08)
captain crunch but with marshmallows it (27:06 - 27:09)
looks like oops all berries (27:08 - 27:12)
wait with marshmallows this is so (27:09 - 27:15)
confusing this is such a (27:12 - 27:17)
we're looking at what are we looking at (27:15 - 27:19)
i'm just i'm doing the deep research man (27:17 - 27:21)
i'm going i'm going in (27:19 - 27:25)
i'm on the dark net so i i wanted the (27:21 - 27:26)
pikachu card (27:25 - 27:29)
so and then look that article was very (27:26 - 27:31)
flavorful there was a lot of (27:29 - 27:33)
there was a lot of pokemon is a general (27:31 - 27:35)
mill series pokemon berry bolt (27:33 - 27:38)
is general very bold why why (27:35 - 27:41)
what are they doing there's no cards in (27:38 - 27:42)
the berry bolts (27:41 - 27:43)
i know there's a pikachu on the cover (27:42 - 27:45)
yeah i have an actual serious question (27:43 - 27:46)
here (27:45 - 27:50)
oh gosh uh people collect a lot of (27:46 - 27:51)
pokemon things (27:50 - 27:53)
people collect true you know everything (27:51 - 27:55)
star wars barbie beanie babies (27:53 - 27:59)
in a situation like this (27:55 - 28:03)
if i'm a pokemon collector and i bought (27:59 - 28:06)
barry bolt what like (28:03 - 28:09)
that's probably not good to leave food (28:06 - 28:10)
in cardboard (28:09 - 28:13)
for 20 some years in a plastic bag in (28:10 - 28:15)
the cardboard cardboard yeah but what if (28:13 - 28:17)
you have like they put into the new york (28:15 - 28:18)
thing (28:17 - 28:19)
what if you live in new york and you (28:18 - 28:21)

milwaukee true two pikachu (28:29 - 28:35)
is a mouse on the cover rats would find (28:32 - 28:37)
the cereal eat through the cardboard (28:35 - 28:39)
baby through the plastic no they'd see (28:37 - 28:41)
the huge electric mouse and be scared (28:39 - 28:42)
away (28:41 - 28:44)
heck no i'm not like i'm not messing (28:42 - 28:46)
with that dude's berry bolts (28:44 - 28:49)
do you uh look the question i'm asking (28:46 - 28:51)
is how do we get a psa 10 (28:49 - 28:54)
pikachu box do we put it in do we send (28:51 - 28:56)
it to psa do they put it in like a (28:54 - 28:59)
uh you no you put it in a plexiglas (28:56 - 29:01)
yeah container this is not the first (28:59 - 29:03)
time people have collected (29:01 - 29:06)
cereal boxes there was a limited (29:03 - 29:09)
amount of ghostbusters cereal back in (29:06 - 29:10)
the day (29:09 - 29:13)
that people have put into class (29:10 - 29:16)
plastic containers and kept forever (29:13 - 29:17)
there's (29:16 - 29:19)
a number of limited editions so you (29:17 - 29:20)
probably you probably don't want to keep (29:19 - 29:20)
it (29:20 - 29:25)
outside of a container because because (29:20 - 29:27)
it'll go bad and it's cardboard if you (29:25 - 29:29)
get a little damp a little more although (29:27 - 29:31)
i have watched people (29:29 - 29:33)
eat 30 year old cereal on youtube that (29:31 - 29:34)
they bought (29:33 - 29:36)
don't do it don't do it but here's okay (29:34 - 29:39)
i have so many questions now number one (29:36 - 29:42)
mr surumi (29:39 - 29:42)
if i am a collector i'm not saying like (29:42 - 29:50)
i i am emphasizing that i am a collector (29:46 - 29:51)
of items (29:50 - 29:52)
the audio version of the show there's a (29:51 - 29:54)
lot of the fingers yes (29:52 - 30:00)
i why i i make an effort to preserve (29:54 - 30:02)
the items that i am collecting in the (30:00 - 30:04)
manner in which they need to be (30:02 - 30:06)
preserved so if i'm collecting (30:04 - 30:10)
cereal in boxes i'm not going to leave (30:06 - 30:11)
it someplace where it's going to get (30:10 - 30:15)
wet basic (30:11 - 30:19)
yeah okay this is another question i (30:15 - 30:20)
have here because you're just not (30:19 - 30:22)
understanding the concept of like no i (30:20 - 30:25)
am i'm just thinking of like the new day (30:22 - 30:25)
cereal (30:25 - 30:28)
the wrestler is the new day they put in (30:25 - 30:30)
a plexi glass container and keep in your (30:28 - 30:31)
freezer (30:30 - 30:32)
right now i think i think they're in a (30:31 - 30:34)
cardboard box in my basement (30:32 - 30:36)
which is probably not good like the (30:34 - 30:38)
basement is the last place for (30:36 - 30:40)
collecting things (30:38 - 30:42)
that's where the rats come in live down (30:40 - 30:43)
there (30:42 - 30:45)
you know where the chubs come in i think (30:43 - 30:47)
of the rat situation because of (30:45 - 30:49)
gosh this podcast is off the rails okay (30:47 - 30:51)
so along (30:49 - 30:52)
trust me i still have some more (30:51 - 30:54)
questions okay okay so i think of the (30:52 - 30:56)
rat situation because (30:54 - 30:59)
it was in wisconsin we get snow (30:56 - 31:01)
this might be unusual to people who (30:59 - 31:02)
don't live in the (31:01 - 31:04)
north part of the united states we get (31:02 - 31:06)
snow we got a lot of snow (31:04 - 31:09)
and uh behind me are some low income (31:06 - 31:10)
apartments (31:09 - 31:12)
you know those the people there are very (31:10 - 31:14)
nice i i know most of them that live (31:12 - 31:14)
there (31:14 - 31:16)
uh but they don't really have like an (31:14 - 31:17)
apartment manager low income it's like (31:16 - 31:19)
some dude who comes by like once a month (31:17 - 31:20)
to collect (31:19 - 31:22)
rent and to like mow the grass yeah (31:20 - 31:24)
right so during the winter (31:22 - 31:28)
uh they the guy who supposed to look (31:24 - 31:30)
after this property he like (31:28 - 31:32)
he brought his truck through to plow the (31:30 - 31:34)
alley and to plow the parking lot (31:32 - 31:35)
but he didn't shovel out the garbage (31:34 - 31:37)
cans so when the garbage men would come (31:35 - 31:39)
once a week because there was not an (31:37 - 31:41)
easy way to get to the res (31:39 - 31:43)
the garbage bins they didn't pick up the (31:41 - 31:45)
garbage and this happened for (31:43 - 31:48)
five weeks in a row of not picking up (31:45 - 31:49)
garbage (31:48 - 31:52)
and then eventually about a week and a (31:49 - 31:53)
half ago (31:52 - 31:56)
wisconsin got up to 50 degrees for like (31:53 - 31:58)
three days in a row (31:56 - 32:00)
so he didn't have to shovel because the (31:58 - 32:01)
snow melted (32:00 - 32:04)
and then you saw the glorious (32:01 - 32:07)
leftovers of what was happened and then (32:04 - 32:09)
the garbage bin eventually picked up the (32:07 - 32:09)
garbage (32:09 - 32:11)
but once it got super nice out and all (32:09 - 32:13)
the snow went away (32:11 - 32:15)
and when you pull out of the alley at 2 (32:13 - 32:17)
a.m you go (32:15 - 32:20)
oh there's a lot of rats over there (32:17 - 32:22)
oh they just came on vacation from new (32:20 - 32:24)
york they were like finally it's our (32:22 - 32:25)
time yeah (32:24 - 32:28)
i'm surprised i'm surprised they the (32:25 - 32:30)
raccoons didn't go first (32:28 - 32:31)
i think the rats at this point are (32:30 - 32:34)
bigger than the raccoons nah (32:31 - 32:37)
they work together (32:34 - 32:37)
true they sort through the things yeah (32:37 - 32:41)
okay (32:40 - 32:45)
i have put in chat the (32:41 - 32:48)
amazon.com listing for a cereal box (32:45 - 32:49)
container (32:48 - 32:51)
well i might buy this put your cereal (32:49 - 32:53)
box you need it (32:51 - 32:56)
32 you also for (32:53 - 32:58)
i think that will pay for your (32:56 - 33:00)
children's college i want it's (32:58 - 33:02)
worth it i'm looking i'm looking at the (33:00 - 33:04)
cereal box holder (33:02 - 33:07)
sports memorabilia display case i would (33:04 - 33:08)
like a a (33:07 - 33:11)
a box a or plexiglas (33:08 - 33:15)
glass box whatever that is like perfect (33:11 - 33:15)
fit (33:15 - 33:17)
that is very satisfying you don't want (33:15 - 33:19)
to like wobble like when you're (33:17 - 33:21)
collecting like a nintendo 64 game (33:19 - 33:24)
you would want that plastic to like fit (33:21 - 33:25)
perfectly (33:24 - 33:27)
over it you don't want i mean there are (33:25 - 33:30)
multiple options listed up at the top (33:27 - 33:33)
and your curatorship of your fine (33:30 - 33:34)
collection (33:33 - 33:37)
yeah where spend (33:34 - 33:41)
the five dollars on the do not touch (33:37 - 33:44)
sign so people aren't picking things up (33:41 - 33:46)
shaking them and causing them to wobble (33:44 - 33:47)
the other dilemmas do i really care (33:46 - 33:49)
about collecting (33:47 - 33:53)
cereal are you a collector or (33:49 - 33:55)
are you in the collecting life or are (33:53 - 33:56)
you a poser (33:55 - 33:58)
well and there's also the set of people (33:56 - 34:00)
who collect pokemon items and the set of (33:58 - 34:03)
people who collect cereals and (34:00 - 34:05)
this is where they intersect but i i (34:03 - 34:06)
have to get back (34:05 - 34:11)
to this greg yes you have a sibling (34:06 - 34:13)
i do you existed in the 70s much like i (34:11 - 34:14)
did (34:13 - 34:17)
so for for the for the youth of our (34:14 - 34:18)
nation it's (34:17 - 34:20)
it's greg and will education time there (34:18 - 34:21)
have been (34:20 - 34:25)
i would say three phases of (34:21 - 34:28)
prizes is the word we will use prizes (34:25 - 34:32)
in cereal so greg in the 70s (34:28 - 34:35)
the prize used to actually be in the (34:32 - 34:36)
cereal (34:35 - 34:39)
the prize could choke you yes but it was (34:36 - 34:41)
something plastic that was in the box of (34:39 - 34:41)
cereal (34:41 - 34:45)
that was usually at the bottom of the (34:41 - 34:48)
actual back (34:45 - 34:50)
not necessarily in its own plastic yes (34:48 - 34:51)
true (34:50 - 34:54)
policy what was the policy in your home (34:51 - 34:58)
in my home the policy was the child (34:54 - 35:01)
whose bowl of cereal the prize fell into (34:58 - 35:05)
is the one who got the prize (35:01 - 35:05)
i don't know that they had an official (35:05 - 35:09)
policy that i can remember i think it (35:07 - 35:11)
was just a free-form (35:09 - 35:14)
fight we used to beat on each other (35:11 - 35:17)
and i almost always lost but (35:14 - 35:19)
usually it was something that my brother (35:17 - 35:21)
didn't want so i almost always got it (35:19 - 35:22)
there you go (35:21 - 35:23)
second phase of surprises in serial (35:22 - 35:25)
history they stopped putting the prizes (35:23 - 35:27)
in the boxes of cereal because too many (35:25 - 35:28)
people (35:27 - 35:30)
choked on them you had to send in cut (35:28 - 35:32)
off the top of the cereal box (35:30 - 35:34)
send it in five to six weeks later you'd (35:32 - 35:36)
get something in the mail (35:34 - 35:38)
this was the true end of prizes yeah (35:36 - 35:40)
that was the worst we are now to modern (35:38 - 35:42)
times (35:40 - 35:44)
because supposedly steve obtained (35:42 - 35:46)
pokemon cards (35:44 - 35:51)
in a box of cereal i bought the (35:46 - 35:51)
tricks that's all they had at target (35:51 - 35:54)
they didn't have the golden grahams they (35:53 - 35:55)
didn't have i gotta go back to this (35:54 - 36:00)
article mr cerumi (35:55 - 36:00)
and you are not according to your (36:04 - 36:07)
driver's license (36:06 - 36:10)
a child explain yourself (36:07 - 36:14)
fix are for kids how you are taking (36:10 - 36:15)
cereal from (36:14 - 36:18)
these poor children i have taken the (36:15 - 36:19)
materials (36:18 - 36:23)
from the specifically designed (36:19 - 36:26)
for only kids nutritional (36:23 - 36:29)
requirements (36:26 - 36:29)
they have golden grahams tricks cocoa (36:30 - 36:33)
puffs (36:33 - 36:35)
cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms (36:33 - 36:37)
wow i probably (36:35 - 36:39)
would have got the cinnamon toast crunch (36:37 - 36:41)
no no (36:39 - 36:41)
of cereal were they floating i haven't (36:53 - 36:58)
seen it yet i haven't opened it yet (36:55 - 37:00)
oh you're waiting for an unboxing video (36:58 - 37:04)
nice shiny or serious (37:00 - 37:07)
i think in the 90s they started putting (37:04 - 37:07)
them (37:07 - 37:09)
outside of the cereal but yeah he's (37:07 - 37:11)
still in the box outside of the cereal (37:09 - 37:13)
the plastic but in between the cardboard (37:11 - 37:16)
yeah less of a choking hat i think so (37:13 - 37:18)
is how people are ripping open boxes in (37:16 - 37:20)
the actual (37:18 - 37:23)
stores and going in and taking the cards (37:20 - 37:23)
out (37:23 - 37:25)
and still leaving a product that you (37:23 - 37:28)
could technically buy horrible (37:25 - 37:30)
horrible nobody's going to touch that (37:28 - 37:32)
box because we don't know if you (37:30 - 37:32)
injected (37:32 - 37:35)
acid into the plastic through a syringe (37:32 - 37:36)
and our design (37:35 - 37:39)
are ready to kill us all (37:36 - 37:39)
now that these shows are on youtube i (37:40 - 37:44)
think of certain words you've got to say (37:42 - 37:46)
and then i think oh we're instantly (37:44 - 37:48)
getting demonetized (37:46 - 37:51)
oh you said the words oh (37:48 - 37:53)
no i just say that because youtube has (37:51 - 37:55)
like youtube's really good at picking up (37:53 - 37:58)
words in videos like their algorithm is (37:55 - 37:58)
very good (37:58 - 38:02)
anyway anyways beep this youtube (37:58 - 38:05)
we have golden grahams tricks cocoa (38:02 - 38:07)
puffs cinnamon toast crunch lucky charms (38:05 - 38:09)
lucky charms at the bottom of the list (38:07 - 38:11)
what why (38:09 - 38:14)
no no no no no no no toast (38:11 - 38:16)
crunch is like i could have had cinnamon (38:14 - 38:17)
toast (38:16 - 38:19)
i could have made the toast to put the (38:17 - 38:20)
butter in the cinnamon it would have (38:19 - 38:21)
been delicious (38:20 - 38:23)
a little bit of sugar okay the official (38:21 - 38:24)
ruling is trix (38:23 - 38:28)
lucky charms cocoa puffs (38:24 - 38:30)
golden grahams cinnamon toast crunch (38:28 - 38:31)
what (38:30 - 38:34)
golden grass (38:31 - 38:34)
they do not taste like graham crackers (38:35 - 38:38)
they don't have golden grahams (38:37 - 38:40)
it's supposed to be like honey and (38:38 - 38:41)
graham crackers and it's not it's just (38:40 - 38:42)
bad (38:41 - 38:43)
there's not a picture here on (38:42 - 38:46)
pokemon.com but it is still (38:43 - 38:49)
slightly better than cinnamon cross (38:46 - 38:50)
toast crunch which is (38:49 - 38:54)
this is horrific is this like uh like uh (38:50 - 38:56)
early 80s things did you guys have like (38:54 - 38:58)
childhood horror of cinnamon toast (38:56 - 38:58)
crunch (38:58 - 39:02)
it tastes bad bad it tastes like (38:58 - 39:05)
cinnamon flavored cardboard (39:02 - 39:09)
trixx trixx has flavor (39:05 - 39:12)
yes yes well trixx had more flavor (39:09 - 39:14)
before they remove the sugar (39:12 - 39:16)
well everything had more flavor for them (39:14 - 39:18)
once again you can go back to what we (39:16 - 39:20)
used to do in the 70s which was like it (39:18 - 39:22)
didn't matter how much the sugar (39:20 - 39:25)
the cereal came with you put a spoonful (39:22 - 39:27)
of sugar on top of your cereal (39:25 - 39:29)
barry poppins told me to twist it in (39:27 - 39:32)
because the milk was obviously too (39:29 - 39:35)
not sugar i don't remember cocoa puffs (39:32 - 39:37)
does cocoa puffs rip up your mouth like (39:35 - 39:39)
captain crunch did no (39:37 - 39:41)
no nothing rips up your mouth like (39:39 - 39:42)
captain crunch does (39:41 - 39:45)
it captain crunch is the original mouth (39:42 - 39:45)
wrecker (39:45 - 39:47)
i would lucky charms would have been (39:45 - 39:49)
probably my number one or number two but (39:47 - 39:51)
when they removed the sugar (39:49 - 39:53)
like that the marshmallows are good like (39:51 - 39:54)
if there was a cereal of just lucky (39:53 - 39:55)
charms marshmallows i'm (39:54 - 39:58)
i'm all in i'd i had to eat it all (39:55 - 39:59)
marshmallows (39:58 - 40:02)
uh but the the oat (39:59 - 40:05)
based whatever things that they have are (40:02 - 40:05)
so (40:05 - 40:09)
flavorless and so dry nowadays (40:05 - 40:11)
that it's just if the bottom of your (40:09 - 40:12)
cereal bowl (40:11 - 40:15)
isn't a thick sludge of milk and sugar (40:12 - 40:17)
like we used to do in the 70s (40:15 - 40:20)
you are not eating your cereal correctly (40:17 - 40:22)
you would get to the bottom and you'd be (40:20 - 40:24)
like stirring the sludge because you got (40:22 - 40:27)
milk sugar to eat yeah i mean i would do (40:24 - 40:29)
that for like cheerios because you (40:27 - 40:30)
needed sugar yeah you're cheerios yeah (40:29 - 40:31)
absolutely (40:30 - 40:34)
and you still do you still do no but the (40:31 - 40:37)
but the marshmallows make up for the (40:34 - 40:37)
fact (40:37 - 40:41)
that the the other part of lucky charms (40:37 - 40:43)
is forgettable that is just there for (40:41 - 40:44)
texture (40:43 - 40:46)
yeah but other parts there i have the (40:44 - 40:47)
marshmallows with it (40:46 - 40:49)
so then you think well i'm taking the (40:47 - 40:51)
best part of lucky charms (40:49 - 40:53)
like the bolt berry i haven't had it yet (40:51 - 40:55)
but it has the lucky charms marshmallows (40:53 - 40:56)
wait were you the kind of person that (40:55 - 40:57)
would pick out (40:56 - 40:59)
all the marshmallows and leave the (40:57 - 41:01)
actual nutrition (40:59 - 41:04)
in the bowl of lucky charms oh yeah (41:01 - 41:08)
yeah hello (41:04 - 41:08)
when i was like eight years old you (41:10 - 41:13)
busted out two bowls (41:11 - 41:15)
and then you poured the cereal in one (41:13 - 41:16)
and then you moved the marshmallows to (41:15 - 41:17)
the other bowl and then when you were (41:16 - 41:19)
done you poured back the nutrition (41:17 - 41:22)
into the box oh you that's why all of (41:19 - 41:25)
your brothers and sisters hate you (41:22 - 41:27)
i i was doing them a favor by giving (41:25 - 41:28)
them nutrition (41:27 - 41:31)
i have one more mystery here (41:28 - 41:34)
which this has now sent me down the path (41:31 - 41:34)
of (41:34 - 41:38)
i cannot determine from the internet (41:34 - 41:41)
whether cookie crisp is still made (41:38 - 41:44)
or not uh i think it's still made (41:41 - 41:48)
cause that was a good cereal (41:44 - 41:48)

cookie crisp (41:54 - 41:56)
let me tell you the best cereal i mean (41:55 - 41:58)
cookie crisp is still made by general (41:56 - 41:59)
mills (41:58 - 42:01)
this is the best supposedly but if they (41:59 - 42:02)
don't have a website (42:01 - 42:04)
for it we'll have to permanently i'm (42:02 - 42:06)
looking at it right now (42:04 - 42:09)
the best cereal is count chocula what (42:06 - 42:12)
i don't like chocolate oh my gosh no (42:09 - 42:14)
blueberries the best blueberry is pretty (42:12 - 42:16)
good too yeah but you can only get that (42:14 - 42:17)
at certain times of the year (42:16 - 42:19)
nothing that's because it's that good (42:17 - 42:21)
nothing top fruit fruit (42:19 - 42:25)
fruit brute was the best (42:21 - 42:25)

much is this pony ponyta card on ebay (42:28 - 42:33)
i don't want to go to walmart (42:30 - 42:33)
plus you need four of them (42:34 - 42:37)
because i'm running a ponyta yeah (42:38 - 42:42)
so like you okay so here's the thing (42:43 - 42:46)
it's like you can't (42:45 - 42:49)
buy cookie crisp in a store you can only (42:46 - 42:51)
order it online it's like a boutique (42:49 - 42:52)
cereal now (42:51 - 42:54)

when you order it (42:54 - 42:59)
that sounds nice sounds fancy i miss (42:56 - 43:00)
yummy mummy too (42:59 - 43:02)
fruit fruit and yummy mummy were so good (43:00 - 43:03)
do you think if the cereal was sitting (43:02 - 43:05)
on your front porch in a box the rats (43:03 - 43:06)
would get it (43:05 - 43:09)
yes no so (43:06 - 43:11)
how long is it out there rats and mice (43:09 - 43:12)
don't like things (43:11 - 43:14)
that are new it needs to have been there (43:12 - 43:16)
for a while so that they assume that (43:14 - 43:17)
nobody's going to touch it because (43:16 - 43:19)
they're very polite that's right and (43:17 - 43:20)
they're like (43:19 - 43:23)
no well it's polite it's like i will (43:20 - 43:25)
i will let everyone else have an (43:23 - 43:27)
opportunity to enjoy this (43:25 - 43:29)
oh nobody else is going to have it are (43:27 - 43:30)
you sure this is how (43:29 - 43:33)
i unfortunately learned that one of my (43:30 - 43:34)
pokemon (43:33 - 43:37)
packages from one of the pokemon events (43:34 - 43:39)
apparently had a cookie in it (43:37 - 43:41)
that i had forgotten about for roughly (43:39 - 43:43)
10 years (43:41 - 43:46)
because i found i found the package and (43:43 - 43:48)
the mice were having a grand old time (43:46 - 43:49)
eating that pokemon cookie (43:48 - 43:52)
oh that's my biggest fierce (43:49 - 43:55)
mice or rats in the house your biggest i (43:52 - 43:56)
mean you have my (43:55 - 43:59)
house right now maybe (43:56 - 44:02)
everybody does whether or not they come (43:59 - 44:03)
into your home (44:02 - 44:06)
is to search for food i mean you have (44:03 - 44:07)
three cats (44:06 - 44:11)
so so maybe not you may never see them (44:07 - 44:14)
i have two dogs who love to hunt mice uh (44:11 - 44:16)
and they're (44:14 - 44:19)
very bad at it well speaking of being (44:16 - 44:20)
bad (44:19 - 44:23)
uh let's take a break nice and when we (44:20 - 44:25)
come back we will talk a little bit more (44:23 - 44:26)
about pokemon (44:25 - 44:28)
news (44:26 - 44:28)
what is a nidoran supposed to be it's a (44:29 - 44:33)
mix of a porcupine (44:32 - 44:37)
a rabbit dinosaurs mouse whales (44:33 - 44:40)
jackalope probably a horse and hamster (44:37 - 44:41)
porcupine (44:40 - 44:45)
a rabbit dinosaur is a mountain whales (44:41 - 44:48)
jackalopes probably a horse (44:45 - 44:51)
yeah but then like what (44:48 - 44:51)
[Music] (44:55 - 45:07)
a rabbit dinosaurs a mouse whale (45:03 - 45:11)
jackalope probably a horse and hamster (45:07 - 45:14)
and we are back uh we don't have a lot (45:11 - 45:15)
of news (45:14 - 45:18)
here uh but the first bit of news we (45:15 - 45:19)
have (45:18 - 45:22)
is korean news um (45:19 - 45:24)
we actually don't know a lot about it (45:22 - 45:25)
but there was uh (45:24 - 45:29)
so um there was an event in japan called (45:25 - 45:31)
the phantom challenge (45:29 - 45:33)
and the phantom challenge allowed you to (45:31 - 45:34)
get a genesect (45:33 - 45:37)
a volcanion and a mar shadow and pokemon (45:34 - 45:38)
sword and shield (45:37 - 45:41)
uh and it was the way you would get that (45:38 - 45:44)
is by going to like 711 in japan and (45:41 - 45:46)
buying stuff or going to the pokemon (45:44 - 45:46)
center (45:46 - 45:47)
and buying stuff i think there were some (45:46 - 45:49)
other stores that participated but like (45:47 - 45:51)
if you bought a pack of cards (45:49 - 45:53)
you would get like four points and if (45:51 - 45:54)
you bought like tea (45:53 - 45:56)
like a t packet at 7 11 you would get (45:54 - 45:58)
one point (45:56 - 46:00)
and i think the t was like 80 yen so (45:58 - 46:01)
that was like the cheapest way to get (46:00 - 46:03)
one point (46:01 - 46:06)
uh and then you would go to this website (46:03 - 46:08)
on (46:06 - 46:10)
pokemon.co.jp and (46:08 - 46:12)
you would redeem the points and then the (46:10 - 46:14)
points would give you genesect (46:12 - 46:17)
volcania and mars shadow there was a (46:14 - 46:18)
master ball it would give you safari (46:17 - 46:19)
ball (46:18 - 46:22)
sports ball other apricorn balls dynite (46:19 - 46:22)
or (46:22 - 46:24)
armorite ore i made a whole youtube (46:22 - 46:26)
video about it on how (46:24 - 46:28)
you can make an account redeem the (46:26 - 46:29)
points (46:28 - 46:31)
i also suggested a couple ebay sellers (46:29 - 46:33)
you could go to because of course if (46:31 - 46:35)
you didn't have a friend in japan that (46:33 - 46:37)
was sending you codes (46:35 - 46:39)
there was some stuff you could import to (46:37 - 46:41)
get the codes as well like you could (46:39 - 46:42)
import (46:41 - 46:45)
shiny star v and shiny star v packs (46:42 - 46:46)
would have the codes (46:45 - 46:49)
so you could get both cards and codes (46:46 - 46:50)
anyways that video (46:49 - 46:52)
is on youtube the phantom challenge in (46:50 - 46:54)
japan goes until april (46:52 - 46:56)
30th so you still have time if you want (46:54 - 46:57)
to get those pokemon (46:56 - 46:59)
but the phantom challenge is coming to (46:57 - 47:01)
korea now (46:59 - 47:03)
they said coming soon so there's not an (47:01 - 47:06)
actual start date but it is the same (47:03 - 47:09)
genesect volcanion mar shadow (47:06 - 47:11)
i don't know if this phantom challenge (47:09 - 47:13)
event will come to the united states (47:11 - 47:16)
if it does it would probably not be go (47:13 - 47:18)
to 7-eleven and buy something for points (47:16 - 47:19)
we've never really had that (47:18 - 47:23)
sort of system uh but i think (47:19 - 47:26)
at least the marshado and the the (47:23 - 47:28)
volcanion are pretty sought after (47:26 - 47:29)
pokemon genesect (47:28 - 47:30)
not so much because genocide was in (47:29 - 47:32)
pokemon go for a very long time (47:30 - 47:35)
it came back quite frequently you can (47:32 - 47:37)
catch as many genesect as you want for a (47:35 - 47:39)
low low price of one dollar a raid pass (47:37 - 47:41)
and then you could transfer those into (47:39 - 47:44)
your pokemon home but volcanion on marsh (47:41 - 47:44)
shadow (47:44 - 47:49)
not so much but whenever (47:44 - 47:51)
i would expect maybe this coming week or (47:49 - 47:52)
next week they'll reveal more (47:51 - 47:55)
more details for the korean event also i (47:52 - 47:57)
just didn't know that pokemon (47:55 - 47:59)

first (49:03 - 49:08)
four figures it was a pre-order uh it (49:04 - 49:11)
is a very big statue it looks like you (49:08 - 49:13)
need two hands to hold it (49:11 - 49:15)
and it i believe so it's coming in (49:13 - 49:17)
november you pre-ordered it on the (49:15 - 49:18)
website (49:17 - 49:21)

little button to light it up (49:27 - 49:32)
it's made by the company who makes it is (49:30 - 49:33)
first (49:32 - 49:36)
four figures i don't know what else they (49:33 - 49:37)
make (49:36 - 49:40)
never heard of them before (49:37 - 49:40)
but this was not the i mean like (49:40 - 49:46)
what was how what was that skylab statue (49:43 - 49:46)
was like what (49:46 - 49:50)
130 and it didn't sell out that quick (49:46 - 49:52)
i don't think it sold out because skyla (49:50 - 49:53)
is not charizard (49:52 - 49:55)
yeah i mean that's really where the (49:53 - 49:57)
conversation was leaning (49:55 - 49:59)
i mean as much as as much as there are (49:57 - 50:01)
vocal people that dislike (49:59 - 50:04)
charizard there are way too many people (50:01 - 50:04)
that love (50:04 - 50:08)
charizard that just they don't care (50:04 - 50:11)
wow this statue is not (50:08 - 50:14)
good no (50:11 - 50:16)
and you know what's funny is like i'm (50:14 - 50:17)
sure it's sold out with a bunch of (50:16 - 50:19)
people who are going to put it on ebay (50:17 - 50:21)
and they don't understand the rule (50:19 - 50:25)
of like real collectibles that people go (50:21 - 50:26)
wild for are usually (50:25 - 50:29)
the ones that are easily portable not (50:26 - 50:31)
something that weighs 10 pounds and (50:29 - 50:33)
you'd have to hold the two hands (50:31 - 50:36)
uh yeah i guess like the skateboards did (50:33 - 50:37)
pretty well (50:36 - 50:40)
resell wise once again very lightweight (50:37 - 50:42)
easy to carry around (50:40 - 50:45)
you think you don't have to carry it you (50:42 - 50:46)
can ride it around (50:45 - 50:49)
you're a shredder (50:46 - 50:49)
i'm trying to see if there's any uh i (50:54 - 50:58)
found the end figure the end figure was (50:56 - 50:59)
sold out i'm pretty sure that was (50:58 - 51:03)
one pretty sure that was 130 (50:59 - 51:06)
when it was up (51:03 - 51:06)
here's the skyla one scala out of stock (51:07 - 51:13)
but it was in stock for quite a while (51:10 - 51:15)

sort of nod while they're flexing in the (53:26 - 53:29)
mirror (53:28 - 53:32)
and you can nod back (53:29 - 53:32)

i mean lionel trains are normally 300 (53:43 - 53:46)
400 yeah (53:45 - 53:50)
because they are quality (53:46 - 53:53)
no i feel like i need i feel like in (53:50 - 53:54)
order to own (53:53 - 53:57)
a train like that i need a living room (53:54 - 54:00)
so big or uh you know when you walk into (53:57 - 54:01)
somebody's house (54:00 - 54:04)
and they just have a bunch of empty (54:01 - 54:06)
space because it's like the foyer (54:04 - 54:08)
and then they have like this grand (54:06 - 54:09)
staircase going up and then you can (54:08 - 54:11)
just like my house yeah there's fancy (54:09 - 54:14)
rooms and stuff (54:11 - 54:17)
like i need a space like that no what (54:14 - 54:18)
you need is a (54:17 - 54:20)
house with a mostly finished basement (54:18 - 54:22)
and you take one of those rooms and that (54:20 - 54:23)
is your pokemon collectible room (54:22 - 54:25)
you have the terrain in the center you (54:23 - 54:27)
have your cereal boxes on one walls you (54:25 - 54:29)
have your plushies on the others (54:27 - 54:32)
and when you bring somebody down and you (54:29 - 54:33)
have the door shut (54:32 - 54:36)
you say are you ready to see something (54:33 - 54:36)
special (54:36 - 54:38)
and then you throw open the door and (54:36 - 54:40)
they faint uh from excitement (54:38 - 54:41)
yes that is from excitement i think (54:40 - 54:43)
maybe train collectors are worse than (54:41 - 54:45)
pokemon collectors (54:43 - 54:48)
they gotta pay like 150 for like a (54:45 - 54:48)
little model (54:48 - 54:50)
tree to sit next to their train i mean (54:48 - 54:52)
it depends on how you (54:50 - 54:55)
define worse than yeah but (54:52 - 54:58)
i think it's a way more expensive hobby (54:55 - 55:00)
oh it's a way more expensive hobby for (54:58 - 55:03)
like hands down like people who collect (55:00 - 55:05)
model trains they're (55:03 - 55:09)
they're entire models of their home (55:05 - 55:12)
towns piece by piece (55:09 - 55:14)
they are taking pictures of you at night (55:12 - 55:16)
so they can model your likeness (55:14 - 55:19)
in the city they are they are the (55:16 - 55:21)
most committed of all collectors and (55:19 - 55:22)
that doesn't come (55:21 - 55:27)
cheap yeah that's probably true (55:22 - 55:30)
um did you buy the appleton plush yet no (55:27 - 55:32)
it sold out instantly unless it's back (55:30 - 55:32)
in stock (55:32 - 55:36)
it's out of stock oh you got me excited (55:32 - 55:37)
for me i was like i'll buy it right now (55:36 - 55:39)
on there (55:37 - 55:39)
we got we got a little time this week to (55:41 - 55:45)
do uh to do (55:43 - 55:46)
a couple questions of the week so we're (55:45 - 55:48)
gonna jump over to our attic channel (55:46 - 55:49)
from our slack (55:48 - 55:52)
community from patreon addict from the (55:49 - 55:53)
slack (55:52 - 55:56)
slack from the patreon uh this is from (55:53 - 56:00)
brian oh sorry greg great question of (55:56 - 56:01)
the week greg (56:00 - 56:03)
i mean we could just go into it it's (56:01 - 56:05)
fine no no no no it's not fine (56:03 - 56:09)
all right i want the question (56:05 - 56:13)
of the week yeah was that like (56:09 - 56:16)
jazz yeah tiny little jazzy (56:13 - 56:20)
uh what pokemon related fad have you not (56:16 - 56:22)
been able to understand no matter how (56:20 - 56:24)
hard you try (56:22 - 56:28)
how are we defining fads like i like (56:24 - 56:30)
the whole pokemon thing overall is a fad (56:28 - 56:32)
i don't i still don't get why people are (56:30 - 56:34)
doing this breakbox thing like you've (56:32 - 56:35)
explained it a lot of times and i still (56:34 - 56:39)
think it sounds like a paramedic (56:35 - 56:39)
it is a pyramid scheme i don't get it (56:39 - 56:46)
and i think that's a fad um (56:42 - 56:49)
true so i'm gonna pick that one so that (56:46 - 56:51)
you two can't use it (56:49 - 56:53)
speaking of the we greg and i were (56:51 - 56:54)
talking about this (56:53 - 56:58)
yes uh because i wanted to do (56:54 - 57:00)
this year i want to do a couple charity (56:58 - 57:01)
events (57:00 - 57:04)
uh we we had a lot of success with the (57:01 - 57:05)
two charity events we did last year we (57:04 - 57:07)
did the color for change (57:05 - 57:10)
change for color color for change (57:07 - 57:13)
and then we ran uh we so we raised um (57:10 - 57:15)
money for that then we raised money for (57:13 - 57:17)
starlight (57:15 - 57:20)
and so i was (57:17 - 57:23)
i i think breakboxes are cool in the (57:20 - 57:25)
concept of how i explained it in my (57:23 - 57:26)
youtube video of like (57:25 - 57:28)
me and will decided to go on our break (57:26 - 57:30)
box instead of going to (57:28 - 57:32)
target and buying packs we can save (57:30 - 57:33)
money if we go into a break box very (57:32 - 57:34)
cool (57:33 - 57:37)
and people do like opening pokemon cards (57:34 - 57:39)
so i was thinking (57:37 - 57:41)
for some charity events in the future we (57:39 - 57:42)
could do (57:41 - 57:45)
a break box but instead of you (57:42 - 57:48)
buying into a pack you're just donating (57:45 - 57:49)
to charity (57:48 - 57:51)
and if you donate to charity i will open (57:49 - 57:53)
a pack in your name (57:51 - 57:56)
and then i will send you the cards and (57:53 - 57:56)
when it's done you're (57:56 - 57:59)
you're buying the pack no i'm not (57:56 - 58:00)
getting into the money it's going right (57:59 - 58:01)
here (58:00 - 58:04)
yes where the money's destination does (58:01 - 58:06)
not change the that's true yeah the (58:04 - 58:07)
money (58:06 - 58:10)
i receive cards from that pack that i (58:07 - 58:11)
sent you money for (58:10 - 58:15)
uh also reminder that we are (58:11 - 58:17)
one year out from the 10-year (58:15 - 58:18)
anniversary (58:17 - 58:22)
of your original pokemon art (58:18 - 58:26)
show it hasn't been 10 years (58:22 - 58:29)
that was 2012 dude (58:26 - 58:32)
oh next year will be 10 years yeah (58:29 - 58:33)
that's what i said we're one year out (58:32 - 58:34)
from 10 years (58:33 - 58:37)
it was time to start planning now (58:34 - 58:40)
so it's not because we're not making (58:37 - 58:42)
those last minute phone calls to me (58:40 - 58:44)
can you call the guy who manages this (58:42 - 58:45)
building because he won't give me the (58:44 - 58:47)
key to get in and i'm like all right (58:45 - 58:50)
put on will anderson business voice (58:47 - 58:52)
i wouldn't want people to donate to (58:50 - 58:54)
charity just to get (58:52 - 58:55)
one booster pack though i would want (58:54 - 58:58)
people to donate to charity (58:55 - 59:01)
because they're donating to charity well (58:58 - 59:04)
yes that's that's how it works i mean (59:01 - 59:06)
but they're donating to charity (59:04 - 59:07)
people donate to charity to get all (59:06 - 59:09)
sorts of things (59:07 - 59:10)
anyways that's like a tried and true (59:09 - 59:12)
fundraising thing yeah oh yeah yeah (59:10 - 59:15)
yeah you know i wouldn't want people to (59:12 - 59:16)
be like (59:15 - 59:19)
20 for a pack of cards you're ripping (59:16 - 59:21)
people off it's like no no no no no no (59:19 - 59:23)
you're you're (59:21 - 59:26)
once again it's it's it's the pokemon go (59:23 - 59:27)
thing it's it applies in all different (59:26 - 59:28)
areas (59:27 - 59:31)
they're they're donating to cherries so (59:28 - 59:32)
charities (59:31 - 59:34)
that they can be part of the experience (59:32 - 59:35)
of you (59:34 - 59:38)
opening the break box yeah but you could (59:35 - 59:39)
argue that you're (59:38 - 59:43)
giving a youtuber 500 to be part of an (59:39 - 59:44)
experience (59:43 - 59:46)
i could argue a lot of things buddy you (59:44 - 59:48)
could argue that but i mean so i think (59:46 - 59:49)
that (59:48 - 59:51)
it's different so there's something (59:49 - 59:53)
different when the person's like i'm (59:51 - 59:55)
just buying it (59:53 - 59:57)
for myself and you can be a part of this (59:55 - 59:58)
there's (59:57 - 60:01)
then i'm running something for charity (59:58 - 60:03)
and as part of this charity event we're (60:01 - 60:05)
doing something unusual (60:03 - 60:09)
that is a very different not (60:05 - 60:12)
selfish sort of i'm making you pay for (60:09 - 60:13)
my content to (60:12 - 60:16)
get a good break like it's like somebody (60:13 - 60:18)
who would shave their head for like five (60:16 - 60:20)
thousand dollars of charity yeah like (60:18 - 60:21)
it costs nothing to shake your head (60:20 - 60:25)
right certainly well aware of that (60:21 - 60:27)
i mean i'm not i will never do that i (60:25 - 60:28)
don't know don't quote me on that (60:27 - 60:30)
uh no but i think like you could charge (60:28 - 60:32)
a premium price (60:30 - 60:35)
because it is for charity like (60:32 - 60:39)
people view rightly so (60:35 - 60:42)
events for charity and associated prices (60:39 - 60:43)
a lot (60:42 - 60:46)
different than this is go this is going (60:43 - 60:48)
straight into my wallet like (60:46 - 60:52)
those aren't equal things on the scale (60:48 - 60:55)
so i mean people like there are (60:52 - 60:57)
auctions where it's like you know here's (60:55 - 60:59)
an edible arrangements (60:57 - 61:02)
retail cost is 50 and people will (60:59 - 61:05)
bid on it and it'll hit 200 (61:02 - 61:07)
because they're really using that as an (61:05 - 61:08)
entryway to (61:07 - 61:12)
get into giving to the charity (61:08 - 61:15)
like it a lot of ways makes it easier (61:12 - 61:17)
for a lot of people to say i can spend a (61:15 - 61:19)
lot of money because i'm still getting a (61:17 - 61:21)
little something out of it but that (61:19 - 61:24)
that sort of helps me overcome (61:21 - 61:27)
some resistances i might have about just (61:24 - 61:28)
i'm just gonna give these people a (61:27 - 61:29)
thousand dollars (61:28 - 61:32)
and feel good about myself like it is (61:29 - 61:32)
just (61:32 - 61:35)
an extra way to get people into the (61:32 - 61:37)
charity because they feel like they're (61:35 - 61:37)
getting (61:37 - 61:40)
a little bit of something out of it yeah (61:37 - 61:41)
yeah yeah (61:40 - 61:44)
whereas a youtuber's breakbox they're (61:41 - 61:46)
like i'll say your name on (61:44 - 61:50)
who cares like (61:46 - 61:52)
i'm paying you a thousand dollars to say (61:50 - 61:53)
my name no (61:52 - 61:56)
thank you and have somebody (61:53 - 62:00)
very famous do it for a lot cheaper (61:56 - 62:01)
you know the fad i don't really (62:00 - 62:03)
understand no i do understand it though (62:01 - 62:07)
but i also don't what is it i like (62:03 - 62:10)
there are fan made pokemon games that (62:07 - 62:10)
are (62:10 - 62:14)
super difficult oh yeah yeah (62:10 - 62:17)
and i have just never seen pokemon (62:14 - 62:21)
as like a hard game (62:17 - 62:24)
and i i say that because i i do (62:21 - 62:26)
understand pokemon i've done a lot of (62:24 - 62:26)
raids (62:26 - 62:30)
dynamaxx adventures with people that (62:26 - 62:32)
sometimes don't understand pokemon as (62:30 - 62:34)
well near storm drain we are not going (62:32 - 62:35)
down this (62:34 - 62:38)
pathway with you um okay (62:35 - 62:40)
i just like if i'm looking for a hard (62:38 - 62:42)
game why would i want to (62:40 - 62:44)
my thought process is if i'm looking for (62:42 - 62:46)
a hard game why would i want to play a (62:44 - 62:48)
fan made game that is doesn't that is (62:46 - 62:50)
that is hard when there are just (62:48 - 62:52)
hard games out there that exist there (62:50 - 62:54)
are varying quality of fan made games (62:52 - 62:55)
and i have played (62:54 - 62:58)
a couple i played the ones that i tend (62:55 - 62:59)
to play (62:58 - 63:03)
are where they have actually (62:59 - 63:06)
altered the pokemon type a little bit so (63:03 - 63:06)
that (63:06 - 63:10)
they are like everybody sort of felt (63:06 - 63:12)
like lex ray should be electric dark so (63:10 - 63:14)
i played a game where they made a (63:12 - 63:16)
luxury electric dark and change the (63:14 - 63:19)
moves so i wasn't there to play (63:16 - 63:20)
for the difficulty because the (63:19 - 63:23)
difficulty is (63:20 - 63:25)
negligible like you can overlevel (63:23 - 63:26)
everything i usually (63:25 - 63:28)
i usually have played those because they (63:26 - 63:31)
have done something (63:28 - 63:34)
they have created their own unique spin (63:31 - 63:37)
on the actual pokemon themselves and (63:34 - 63:39)
have altered the game that way (63:37 - 63:43)
and i would like to experience that um (63:39 - 63:45)
the the difficulty thing is whatever (63:43 - 63:46)
like (63:45 - 63:50)
pokemon's never ever no no turn-based (63:46 - 63:52)
leveling game is ever going to be (63:50 - 63:56)
difficult if you can over level well i (63:52 - 63:59)
i would tell there's actually a flaw (63:56 - 64:03)
in steve's thinking a fundamental flaw (63:59 - 64:06)
for the last 32 years in this particular (64:03 - 64:06)
topic (64:06 - 64:09)
and it's it's it's around you're like (64:06 - 64:10)
why (64:09 - 64:12)
if i'm looking for a difficult game why (64:10 - 64:14)
would i play pokemon that's that's not (64:12 - 64:17)
that's not where this is coming from i (64:14 - 64:18)
will tell you the (64:17 - 64:22)
brief story my the first guy that i ever (64:18 - 64:23)
dated (64:22 - 64:28)
his favorite band was you too (64:23 - 64:31)
to the point that he would literally (64:28 - 64:33)
still actually to this day only listen (64:31 - 64:35)
to you two (64:33 - 64:37)
he has every single youtube album he's a (64:35 - 64:39)
member of their fan club he goes and (64:37 - 64:41)
whenever they're on tour he follows them (64:39 - 64:42)
around the world (64:41 - 64:46)
will not listen to another band (64:42 - 64:50)
there are pokemon fans out there who (64:46 - 64:52)
the only game that they ever want to (64:50 - 64:54)
play (64:52 - 64:56)
is pokemon they don't want to find (64:54 - 64:59)
another game that could possibly be more (64:56 - 65:00)
difficult (64:59 - 65:02)
they only want to play pokemon and if i (65:00 - 65:03)
can get pokemon (65:02 - 65:05)
difficult flavor all the better because (65:03 - 65:07)
i'm just gonna play pokemon (65:05 - 65:09)
so give it to me in a version that's (65:07 - 65:11)
more challenging for me (65:09 - 65:14)
yeah i it's like if i wa if the (65:11 - 65:15)
difficulty is (65:14 - 65:18)
i want to lose and suffer over and over (65:15 - 65:21)
i can just yeah i can just go on ranked (65:18 - 65:24)
ladder and i can lose this (65:21 - 65:24)
it's in the game i mean there is a (65:24 - 65:28)
different thing there there (65:26 - 65:31)
is in certain fan games you know i've (65:28 - 65:31)
watched (65:31 - 65:34)
i have watched many a youtuber do let's (65:31 - 65:35)
play in randomizers there is something (65:34 - 65:37)
about a game that you know (65:35 - 65:40)
very very well and i watch a friend of (65:37 - 65:41)
the show vince i watch (65:40 - 65:45)
vince do randomizers uh for vince's (65:41 - 65:48)
favorite game and there's something (65:45 - 65:51)
exciting about not (65:48 - 65:53)
knowing what's going to happen in a game (65:51 - 65:54)
that you know (65:53 - 65:58)
very very well uh so (65:54 - 66:00)
there is something exciting about (65:58 - 66:01)
randomizers or (66:00 - 66:04)
a person that has changed the (66:01 - 66:07)
nature aspects of the parts of the game (66:04 - 66:08)
because (66:07 - 66:12)
there is a sense of (66:08 - 66:14)
i'm going to get a bunch of surprises (66:12 - 66:16)
out of a thing that i already know (66:14 - 66:16)
really well (66:16 - 66:18)
and love and there's a lot of excitement (66:16 - 66:19)
there it's it's it's (66:18 - 66:22)
also why i like a lot of remakes because (66:19 - 66:23)
sometimes they will sneak things in (66:22 - 66:24)
there that are like (66:23 - 66:26)
oh they changed this or they did this a (66:24 - 66:28)
little bit different and those sort of (66:26 - 66:30)
surprises are very exciting to me as (66:28 - 66:31)
well i think (66:30 - 66:34)
there's a lot of that in in those fan (66:31 - 66:35)
made games (66:34 - 66:39)
that are very appealing there's just (66:35 - 66:42)
i i i do see an appeal (66:39 - 66:45)
to i can't remember that game that vince (66:42 - 66:45)
plays (66:45 - 66:48)
um but i've seen like majora's mask (66:45 - 66:49)
randomizers (66:48 - 66:52)
uh where they're built in a way where (66:49 - 66:53)
you can still beat it but you know you (66:52 - 66:55)
get you might do dungeons in a different (66:53 - 66:56)
order you might get (66:55 - 66:58)
things in a different order and if you (66:56 - 67:00)
really like that game i guess i see that (66:58 - 67:02)
appeal but for me there's just so many (67:00 - 67:03)
video games out there (67:02 - 67:04)
and i'm sure people listening to the (67:03 - 67:06)
show they probably have like 40 games in (67:04 - 67:08)
their steam (67:06 - 67:10)
list that they bought on sale that they (67:08 - 67:12)
never played that (67:10 - 67:16)
no i just keep buying the game (67:12 - 67:16)
like if i if i had unlimited free time i (67:19 - 67:23)
feel like i would just want to play (67:21 - 67:25)
other games and get that like this is (67:23 - 67:26)
the first time (67:25 - 67:30)
in in a really long time where i have (67:26 - 67:33)
sat down and played a (67:30 - 67:36)
different jrpg i bought bravely default (67:33 - 67:36)
2 (67:36 - 67:38)
and i've been playing through it and the (67:36 - 67:41)
last rpg i played was persona 5 which (67:38 - 67:43)
was gosh what was that three years ago (67:41 - 67:44)
now (67:43 - 67:47)
um so it's very rare that i've i've (67:44 - 67:49)
played a different rpg that isn't (67:47 - 67:50)
pokemon and i play a lot of pokemon (67:49 - 67:51)
obviously (67:50 - 67:53)
play it every day on stream but when (67:51 - 67:55)
when i play those games i just think (67:53 - 67:59)
of how dramatically different they are (67:55 - 68:00)
for pokemon and i see (67:59 - 68:03)
that more as a plus than going like oh i (68:00 - 68:05)
just changed lux rated dark type isn't (68:03 - 68:07)
this game zany now it's like (68:05 - 68:09)
no not really yeah but i mean this is (68:07 - 68:10)
the same phenomenon (68:09 - 68:14)
i have at least seven (68:10 - 68:17)
streaming services that i pay for and (68:14 - 68:20)
what am i watching again i've restarted (68:17 - 68:21)
legend of korra because there is (68:20 - 68:22)
something (68:21 - 68:26)
even though i could watch (68:22 - 68:29)
anything else i know for a fact (68:26 - 68:33)
that i like this thing i don't know that (68:29 - 68:33)
i'm (68:33 - 68:35)
investing time and effort money into (68:33 - 68:37)
something that i don't like (68:35 - 68:40)
and that's always sort of the risk of (68:37 - 68:41)
going with something (68:40 - 68:44)
new new is (68:41 - 68:44)
sometimes you don't want new new (68:45 - 68:48)
sometimes you want (68:47 - 68:51)
comfort and have it changed a little bit (68:48 - 68:52)
sometimes you want (68:51 - 68:54)
sometimes you want the special edition (68:52 - 68:56)
of star wars instead of the original (68:54 - 68:57)
version of star wars (68:56 - 69:00)
sometimes what no (68:57 - 69:02)
nobody ever wants that stop with your (69:00 - 69:05)
controversial opinions (69:02 - 69:08)
sometimes you want the prequels and not (69:05 - 69:09)
the (69:08 - 69:12)
original trilogy there (69:09 - 69:14)
i mean they exist in the same time and i (69:12 - 69:15)
don't think it's a i don't think it's a (69:14 - 69:18)
fair criticism just to say (69:15 - 69:20)
oh just play a different game if you (69:18 - 69:22)
want harder because the impulse to play (69:20 - 69:24)
something that is very comforting and (69:22 - 69:27)
something you know well but have it (69:24 - 69:29)
have it seem like a fresh new experience (69:27 - 69:30)
is something we do (69:29 - 69:33)
in a lot of other multimedia and we (69:30 - 69:35)
don't rag on people for like oh you've (69:33 - 69:36)
watched parkins parks and recs for the (69:35 - 69:38)
15th time in a row (69:36 - 69:40)
we don't look at them and say why don't (69:38 - 69:44)
you watch the office (69:40 - 69:44)
i think there are but they're jerks (69:44 - 69:50)
i mean i do that to my twitch chat all (69:48 - 69:52)
the time they're like hey steve why (69:50 - 69:54)
don't you watch all these animes why (69:52 - 69:55)
i've only seen like three enemies why (69:54 - 69:57)
would i watch anything is it gonna be (69:55 - 69:59)
better than full metal alchemist (69:57 - 70:01)
brotherhood yes probably (69:59 - 70:03)
uh no some of them are better than the (70:01 - 70:05)
full metal alchemist brotherhood does (70:03 - 70:06)
set a high bar (70:05 - 70:10)
but it is very good the highest of bars (70:06 - 70:12)
it's a pretty high bar in this house but (70:10 - 70:14)
i mean so (70:12 - 70:16)
if they released yet another full metal (70:14 - 70:17)
alchemist (70:16 - 70:20)
that was a that was 90 the same story (70:17 - 70:22)
because they did this (70:20 - 70:26)
yes that is like releasing a fan game of (70:22 - 70:28)
pokemon (70:26 - 70:30)
you would be tempted to watch the third (70:28 - 70:32)
version of full metal alchemist because (70:30 - 70:33)
you really liked it (70:32 - 70:34)
and you're curious about what they (70:33 - 70:36)
changed i guess i'm in a position where (70:34 - 70:37)
i'm not (70:36 - 70:40)
ever bored with pokemon like i like (70:37 - 70:44)
like we we literally have a to-do list (70:40 - 70:45)
list (70:44 - 70:47)
i'm never bored with pokemon either but (70:45 - 70:49)
sometimes i'm like i (70:47 - 70:51)
i'm making room on my list to have this (70:49 - 70:52)
experience to see if i like it (70:51 - 70:54)
yeah yeah i just like i have my ribbon (70:52 - 70:56)
quest i have a nuzlocke i am trying to (70:54 - 70:57)
complete the (70:56 - 71:00)
the pokedex in in black two white two (70:57 - 71:03)
oh good luck with that open shiny years (71:00 - 71:04)
you've been trying to complete that (71:03 - 71:06)
gosh it's been like two years like i (71:04 - 71:08)
have so many things to do (71:06 - 71:13)
in pokemon that i can't fathom trying to (71:08 - 71:15)
trying to do a fan made game and a part (71:13 - 71:17)
of that and i'm well aware part of that (71:15 - 71:17)
is (71:17 - 71:20)
like that's not why i come to pokemon (71:17 - 71:22)
right like i i can't i (71:20 - 71:25)
feel good playing through fire red leaf (71:22 - 71:26)
green (71:25 - 71:30)
because i can move this pokemon up um (71:26 - 71:32)
i mean one of your main reasons is for (71:30 - 71:34)
collecting yes (71:32 - 71:35)
like for me one of my main reasons is (71:34 - 71:38)
for story so if i can get (71:35 - 71:40)
a story set in a region that i like that (71:38 - 71:43)
feels new or has been changed (71:40 - 71:47)
that is a draw to me and if i wanted if (71:43 - 71:48)
i wanted it to be (71:47 - 71:52)
harder i could set those rules on myself (71:48 - 71:54)
and people do that's why nuzlockes exist (71:52 - 71:55)
yeah (71:54 - 71:58)
and i've gotten better at the game (71:55 - 72:00)
just because of learning how to (71:58 - 72:02)
competitive battle (72:00 - 72:05)
and i can't take that knowledge of i (72:02 - 72:07)
have a dialga that is now electric (72:05 - 72:11)
fairy because that just throws it all (72:07 - 72:12)
off (72:11 - 72:15)
that doesn't like teach me anything i (72:12 - 72:17)
mean it does (72:15 - 72:20)
i mean yeah if i was there i know how to (72:17 - 72:22)
make a chocolate cake so therefore (72:20 - 72:23)
learning how to make a (72:22 - 72:26)
lemon chiffon three layer cake will (72:23 - 72:27)
teach me nothing (72:26 - 72:30)
i already know cake i do like lemon cake (72:27 - 72:34)
i love lemon cake it's my favorite uh (72:30 - 72:36)
i mean you're not i mean you're in it (72:34 - 72:38)
for very different reasons (72:36 - 72:42)
uh and that's valid like a fan-made game (72:38 - 72:45)
for how you enjoy consuming pokemon (72:42 - 72:48)
means nothing to you yeah yeah yeah like (72:45 - 72:49)
you are not (72:48 - 72:51)
you are never going to be a person that (72:49 - 72:53)
is in (72:51 - 72:55)
to playing pokemon for the reasons why (72:53 - 72:57)
people turn to fan made games (72:55 - 72:59)
yeah and i i could play pokemon every (72:57 - 73:00)
day i mean i have (72:59 - 73:03)
i have played every day um and i am i'm (73:00 - 73:04)
still not bored with it so (73:03 - 73:08)
i i'm i'm i would assume that the people (73:04 - 73:09)
that turn to fan made games are bored (73:08 - 73:10)
with the general (73:09 - 73:13)
in and out and or (73:10 - 73:15)
they're just what you said which i (73:13 - 73:16)
didn't think about they don't want to (73:15 - 73:17)
try anything new (73:16 - 73:19)
right i mean i have turned to fan main (73:17 - 73:21)
games and i will hardly say that i'm (73:19 - 73:22)
bored with pokemon but sometimes i've (73:21 - 73:24)
gone to them being like (73:22 - 73:27)
i want to revisit this and i want it to (73:24 - 73:29)
feel a little bit different and i don't (73:27 - 73:31)
want to erase my current game (73:29 - 73:33)
so yeah that's my thing it's like i (73:31 - 73:35)
never want to erase a pokemon cartridge (73:33 - 73:37)
that i've played through because that's (73:35 - 73:38)
my story (73:37 - 73:41)
yeah yeah i'm the same way with that one (73:38 - 73:41)
i have been known to buy three and four (73:42 - 73:45)
copies of (73:44 - 73:46)
game and i'm like i want to play it (73:45 - 73:49)
again like the fact that i can create (73:46 - 73:52)
new profiles on the switch to start the (73:49 - 73:54)
game over again has been a (73:52 - 73:57)
life changer you do you know x and y is (73:54 - 73:59)
up to 50 bucks now used (73:57 - 74:03)
really yeah that game's not good (73:59 - 74:06)
well how much (74:03 - 74:08)
how much is heart gold soul silver with (74:06 - 74:09)
the pokewalker (74:08 - 74:12)
with pokewalker is a hundred probably (74:09 - 74:14)
120. (74:12 - 74:17)
how much is uh box going for right now (74:14 - 74:21)
i mean see if i can tell probably 800. (74:17 - 74:23)
oh boy you want to sell your pokemon box (74:21 - 74:24)
to me greg no never (74:23 - 74:29)
okay never mind you can borrow it (74:24 - 74:32)
this is from casey with uh understanding (74:29 - 74:33)
that people (74:32 - 74:35)
enjoy playing differently i look i (74:33 - 74:36)
didn't mean to line up these two (74:35 - 74:37)
questions (74:36 - 74:39)
yeah you did uh why do people put so (74:37 - 74:42)
much weight in things like smogon (74:39 - 74:45)
uh this is an unofficial fan generated (74:42 - 74:47)
thing but some people look at it as (74:45 - 74:49)
actual competitive pokemon when it's (74:47 - 74:50)
clearly not (74:49 - 74:52)
boy oh boy it's a good question (74:50 - 74:55)
[Laughter] (74:52 - 74:58)
here's the thing that i cannot knock (74:55 - 75:00)
smoke on for (74:58 - 75:03)
is they are a group of people that have (75:00 - 75:04)
dissected the (75:03 - 75:08)
math they have gone through trolled like (75:04 - 75:11)
they do know what they are (75:08 - 75:13)
talking about when they are talking (75:11 - 75:15)
about how pokemon works (75:13 - 75:18)
how the moves work like (75:15 - 75:20)
if nothing else their level of knowledge (75:18 - 75:21)
is very (75:20 - 75:25)
high and when you have a high (75:21 - 75:27)
knowledge about something people do look (75:25 - 75:29)
at you like an expert (75:27 - 75:33)
on that thing so you may not like (75:29 - 75:36)
what smogon does for rule sets they (75:33 - 75:37)
focus on a very (75:36 - 75:39)
unique aspect of the game they have (75:37 - 75:41)
focused on what they (75:39 - 75:44)
think better balances the game and makes (75:41 - 75:45)
the game more (75:44 - 75:49)
fun based off of how their users (75:45 - 75:52)
play it but there is still a benefit (75:49 - 75:56)
from going to a group of people who are (75:52 - 75:58)
very very knowledgeable in certain (75:56 - 76:00)
aspects of the game (75:58 - 76:03)
and learning from them so by that fact (76:00 - 76:05)
alone smogon carries weight (76:03 - 76:08)
because they have a history of being (76:05 - 76:09)
able to do (76:08 - 76:13)
really in-depth analysis and tell you (76:09 - 76:14)
[Music] (76:13 - 76:16)
explain show you the math of how they (76:14 - 76:18)
got there that is that is (76:16 - 76:19)
has an important place and you can (76:18 - 76:21)
choose to follow them or not (76:19 - 76:25)
but they are experts i would say (76:21 - 76:27)
my way of saying pretty much the same (76:25 - 76:28)
thing that greg said with a slightly (76:27 - 76:30)
different spin (76:28 - 76:33)
is the the goal (76:30 - 76:36)
of smogon and the smoke on tears (76:33 - 76:40)
is to create a competitive pokemon (76:36 - 76:44)
environment where there is (76:40 - 76:47)
a management of the metagame so that (76:44 - 76:48)
there actually (76:47 - 76:50)
is balance in the way that the game is (76:48 - 76:52)
played so you don't end up like (76:50 - 76:55)
in standard vgc where the top 10 teams (76:52 - 76:55)
were (76:55 - 76:59)
pretty much all the same pokemon same (76:55 - 76:59)
stats (76:59 - 77:02)
same everything maybe (76:59 - 77:04)
i used to have this feeling but i (77:02 - 77:06)
disagree okay but no no so (77:04 - 77:09)
so i would say that is the intent of (77:06 - 77:10)
smogon (77:09 - 77:14)
the problem that comes out of it (77:10 - 77:17)
are the number of people who then (77:14 - 77:22)
take that to mean that smogon tears (77:17 - 77:24)
are real pokemon battling because i have (77:22 - 77:26)
literally (77:24 - 77:30)
been at pokemon like a competitive vgc (77:26 - 77:33)
events where i have (77:30 - 77:36)
had teams and somebody said well that's (77:33 - 77:38)
not allowed (77:36 - 77:40)
and i said if it wasn't allowed then the (77:38 - 77:42)
rules that we downloaded onto my 3ds (77:40 - 77:44)
would have stopped me from doing this (77:42 - 77:47)
you just don't understand that smogon is (77:44 - 77:49)
not vgc (77:47 - 77:52)
right and vgc is its own environment (77:49 - 77:54)
yeah like smogon has like sand attack (77:52 - 77:55)
band and like double team band (77:54 - 77:59)
yeah and also i will say probably (77:55 - 78:03)
smogon had more validity (77:59 - 78:07)
years ago when tpci was not doing like (78:03 - 78:10)
seasons of vgc and altering what's (78:07 - 78:12)
and actually having banned lists it's (78:10 - 78:15)
like they would update the vgc (78:12 - 78:18)
once a year at most versus once a month (78:15 - 78:21)
like they do now (78:18 - 78:21)
yeah i when i when i saw this quest i'm (78:21 - 78:25)
gonna go back to the first question what (78:23 - 78:25)
fan (78:25 - 78:27)
what pokemon fad do you not understand (78:25 - 78:28)
how hard you try i don't understand (78:27 - 78:32)
people who do competitive single battles (78:28 - 78:32)
it's like just do double like doubles is (78:32 - 78:38)
significantly better oh no no rotation (78:35 - 78:41)
is significant forever (78:38 - 78:45)
so like smoke on to me is like the (78:41 - 78:48)
competitive smash scene they hate (78:45 - 78:51)
fun they they take everything they take (78:48 - 78:53)
everything out (78:51 - 78:55)
cause is very they they don't like the (78:53 - 78:57)
randomization either like they don't (78:55 - 78:58)
like (78:57 - 79:01)
um like like santa tech and double team (78:58 - 79:02)
is like the obvious (79:01 - 79:04)
thing they they ban sand attack and they (79:02 - 79:05)
ban double team these are both moves (79:04 - 79:07)
that have counters to (79:05 - 79:10)
use aerial ace air release never misses (79:07 - 79:12)
there's plenty of moves (79:10 - 79:14)
that get around double team and sand (79:12 - 79:16)
attack taunt is another one use taunt (79:14 - 79:20)
um but (79:16 - 79:23)
because singles is just bad it doesn't (79:20 - 79:27)
work as well as it would in a doubles (79:23 - 79:30)
format would um also dynamax like if (79:27 - 79:32)
somebody sand attacked you six times you (79:30 - 79:33)
can just dynomax and (79:32 - 79:37)
you don't miss uh but like (79:33 - 79:40)
it's weird in the sense of i think of (79:37 - 79:40)
other (79:40 - 79:43)
nintendo published games like mario kart (79:40 - 79:46)
i don't there is probably competitive (79:43 - 79:48)
mario kart out there with items (79:46 - 79:51)
off completely i just (79:48 - 79:54)
can't ever imagine doing that so when i (79:51 - 79:55)
wouldn't you just (79:54 - 79:57)
play a racing game well well that's (79:55 - 79:58)
that's what i think when i watch (79:57 - 80:00)
competitive smash and i know there are (79:58 - 80:02)
people that super super love competitive (80:00 - 80:03)
smash but why why (80:02 - 80:06)
like smash is has items dropping and (80:03 - 80:08)
there's things on the map (80:06 - 80:11)
and and people can probably and i'm sure (80:08 - 80:13)
people have gotten really good with the (80:11 - 80:14)
items that exist and with the (80:13 - 80:17)
the maps that change and stuff but like (80:14 - 80:18)
if you don't want any items or any (80:17 - 80:20)
randomizations why aren't you just (80:18 - 80:21)
playing a different fight (80:20 - 80:23)
yeah this is actually the perfect segue (80:21 - 80:24)
for me to announce my um (80:23 - 80:26)
entry into the world of professional (80:24 - 80:29)
mortal kombat (80:26 - 80:29)
okay all right so i'm gonna become a pro (80:30 - 80:34)
more mortal combat player (80:31 - 80:36)
well but with gosh i was watching a (80:34 - 80:38)
streamer the other day (80:36 - 80:41)
and they were doing a um they were doing (80:38 - 80:44)
smogon standard singles and there was a (80:41 - 80:46)
toxic croak that got sent out (80:44 - 80:49)
so the player's best option was to send (80:46 - 80:51)
in a puka muku (80:49 - 80:53)
because the toxic croak already sword (80:51 - 80:54)
stanced (80:53 - 80:57)
this was a single battle and so the (80:54 - 80:58)
player blocked (80:57 - 81:01)
the toxic crook from switching and then (80:58 - 81:02)
the toxic croak (81:01 - 81:04)
drain punched and then the pukamiku (81:02 - 81:06)
recovered and the toxic (81:04 - 81:08)
drain punched the pukamuku recovered and (81:06 - 81:11)
i'm not exaggerating oh how exciting (81:08 - 81:14)
they were on turn 54. (81:11 - 81:18)
of their battle before (81:14 - 81:20)
one of the because the puka muku (81:18 - 81:22)
couldn't switch out because the toxic (81:20 - 81:23)
croak did (81:22 - 81:25)
four three swords dances which is max (81:23 - 81:26)
max's (81:25 - 81:28)
physical attack and the toxic crow (81:26 - 81:30)
couldn't switch because it was (81:28 - 81:32)
blocked and the puka muku couldn't do (81:30 - 81:34)
any damage because uh it (81:32 - 81:36)
because toxic kirk's dry skin ability (81:34 - 81:38)
didn't let pukimi could do any damage so (81:36 - 81:39)
it was literally (81:38 - 81:43)
drain punch recover drain punch recover (81:39 - 81:46)
until both pokemon ran out of pp (81:43 - 81:50)
and the the the streamer still lost (81:46 - 81:53)
but it was like a hundred turn game (81:50 - 81:56)
why real 6d chess right there why would (81:53 - 81:58)
anyone want to do that why would you (81:56 - 81:59)
want to spend (81:58 - 82:03)
50 plus minutes in a pokemon match (81:59 - 82:05)
and every singles match is the same (82:03 - 82:07)
we're going to set up toxic (82:05 - 82:08)
we're going to set up some spikes we're (82:07 - 82:10)
going to stop some stealth rocks (82:08 - 82:11)
we're going to protect we're going to (82:10 - 82:13)
protect we're going to hope that they (82:11 - 82:14)
switch here we're going to swords dance (82:13 - 82:15)
okay we're going to sweep now (82:14 - 82:17)
like nah my cloister is going to rapid (82:15 - 82:19)
spin (82:17 - 82:22)
i mean there are it's it's so (82:19 - 82:27)
painful to not only play but to watch is (82:22 - 82:29)
awesome for you for people that really (82:27 - 82:31)
really like that like (82:29 - 82:33)
there are people there are people who (82:31 - 82:36)
like to watch (82:33 - 82:39)
who like to watch ad play golf (82:36 - 82:41)
people like to watch and play golf one (82:39 - 82:43)
of the slowest games (82:41 - 82:46)
out there you can watch bowling well (82:43 - 82:47)
yeah you can watch (82:46 - 82:50)
bowling yes (82:47 - 82:50)
there are people that enjoy that style (82:50 - 82:55)
of play there are people who see (82:53 - 82:57)
a different level of skill in that type (82:55 - 82:58)
of play than (82:57 - 83:01)
in doubles like (82:58 - 83:04)
doubles has more practical (83:01 - 83:07)
real world used if you want to go into (83:04 - 83:07)
the vc (83:07 - 83:11)
vgc scene but there is something (83:07 - 83:13)
amongst a group of people or like we're (83:11 - 83:15)
doing singles and we're going to come up (83:13 - 83:17)
with this and they can be marathon (83:15 - 83:19)
matches they can be quick matches like (83:17 - 83:21)
it is a different skill set that they (83:19 - 83:23)
value (83:21 - 83:25)
you don't have to value it oh i don't (83:23 - 83:27)
they do and we know you don't (83:25 - 83:29)
like when i when i'm going i'm going (83:27 - 83:30)
through a heart gold soul silver (83:29 - 83:33)
nuzlocke and uh (83:30 - 83:36)
murdering pokemon none of the gym (83:33 - 83:38)
leaders have been hard (83:36 - 83:41)
and the things that worry me the (83:38 - 83:43)
most and the things that i have almost (83:41 - 83:46)
lost my entire team to (83:43 - 83:49)
is any trainer in a double battle (83:46 - 83:51)
because they just have so many more (83:49 - 83:52)
options (83:51 - 83:54)
um and they they have so much more (83:52 - 83:56)
coverage (83:54 - 83:59)
that um like for example (83:56 - 84:02)
bugsy was super easy i just (83:59 - 84:04)
i just used harden like four times in a (84:02 - 84:06)
row and a geodude and then i just rock (84:04 - 84:08)
through it after i was done setting up (84:06 - 84:08)
like (84:08 - 84:10)
bugsy couldn't touch me whitney was also (84:08 - 84:12)
super easy literally (84:10 - 84:14)
same strategy just harden like twice (84:12 - 84:16)
okay if miltank stomps or rolls out it (84:14 - 84:18)
does like one to two damage (84:16 - 84:21)
and then i just rock throw it like every (84:18 - 84:23)
gym leader so far in this nuzlocke has (84:21 - 84:24)
been a complete pushover (84:23 - 84:27)
and there was one trainer in harcole (84:24 - 84:29)
soul silver in particular (84:27 - 84:32)
all like i was over leveled i was 32 (84:29 - 84:33)
when i got to him (84:32 - 84:36)
both his pokemon were 25 he had an (84:33 - 84:37)
electabuzz (84:36 - 84:39)
and he had a magmar and between those (84:37 - 84:40)
two pokemon (84:39 - 84:44)
he could one shot anything (84:40 - 84:47)
if if i did a bad switch or if i didn't (84:44 - 84:50)
like target or prioritize and if he (84:47 - 84:52)
would have knocked out one or two (84:50 - 84:52)
pokemon (84:52 - 84:55)
he would have knocked out my whole team (84:52 - 84:57)
like i just think double battles are (84:55 - 84:58)
significantly more interesting and (84:57 - 85:01)
significantly more challenging than (84:58 - 85:03)
than the single format offers but i get (85:01 - 85:05)
why pokemon does single format because (85:03 - 85:07)
it is very easy (85:05 - 85:09)
on a player to understand this is a fire (85:07 - 85:10)
pokemon (85:09 - 85:12)
i have a grass pokemon i will switch to (85:10 - 85:14)
a water pokemon it is a lot (85:12 - 85:17)
harder to comprehend they have a fire (85:14 - 85:19)
and an electric if i switch out a water (85:17 - 85:21)
pokemon i can do the fire but the (85:19 - 85:23)
electric can get me if i switch in a (85:21 - 85:27)
uh grass pokemon well that's just a bad (85:23 - 85:29)
switching and all together you need (85:27 - 85:32)
ground yeah you need to rock around (85:29 - 85:35)
but triple battles though yeah (85:32 - 85:38)
that's what the real magic is that's the (85:35 - 85:40)
that's the real (85:38 - 85:42)
will what is our pokemon of the week uh (85:40 - 85:44)
well last week's pokemon of the week we (85:42 - 85:45)
were doing (85:44 - 85:48)
easy um so i listed off that (85:45 - 85:51)
uh it's part of a family that includes a (85:48 - 85:52)
whole bunch of different types but not (85:51 - 85:53)
all (85:52 - 85:56)
of the types and it (85:53 - 86:01)
required uh you to be in a specific (85:56 - 86:04)
location for evolution (86:01 - 86:07)
um and then also mentioned that in (86:04 - 86:10)
one episode of the cartoon cynthia used (86:07 - 86:12)
one to freeze some river water because (86:10 - 86:13)
melowetta was sick (86:12 - 86:16)
and she needed a little ice pack (86:13 - 86:18)
it needed an ice pack and then oshawott (86:16 - 86:20)
fell in love with mellowetta that's a (86:18 - 86:21)
great episode (86:20 - 86:24)
um and (86:21 - 86:26)
uh the only place that you've ever been (86:24 - 86:28)
able to find one of these (86:26 - 86:32)
in the wild to catch it was in galler (86:28 - 86:34)
and also they have switched and somebody (86:32 - 86:35)
debated with me (86:34 - 86:39)
over whether you use a held item but i (86:35 - 86:40)
believe that's the official term for (86:39 - 86:41)
items that pokemon (86:40 - 86:44)
can hold even if they can also just be (86:41 - 86:47)
applied to evolve that pokemon (86:44 - 86:49)
although maybe evolution item i don't (86:47 - 86:50)
know either way you (86:49 - 86:53)
can have a pokemon hold this particular (86:50 - 86:53)
item (86:53 - 86:55)
you don't have to use it to evolve them (86:53 - 86:57)
so that's why i consider it a held item (86:55 - 86:58)
but either way (86:57 - 86:59)
you no longer need to be in a specific (86:58 - 87:02)
location you just apply this item and (86:59 - 87:05)
the pokemon evolves (87:02 - 87:09)
it's chat (87:05 - 87:12)
chat does not evolve or yes no not with (87:09 - 87:13)
that attitude (87:12 - 87:15)
it's not an april remix that's evolving (87:13 - 87:16)
into (87:15 - 87:20)
dynamaxx mega chat wow (87:16 - 87:24)
gigantic mac chat scream scream stat (87:20 - 87:29)
it's glacion easy mode it was glacion (87:24 - 87:30)
you are correct (87:29 - 87:34)
uh i officially hate (87:30 - 87:37)
shuffle i hate it shuffle like huh oh (87:34 - 87:40)
uh do you know (87:37 - 87:40)
look i've made it through the whole (87:41 - 87:43)
episode without saying anything bad (87:42 - 87:44)
about heart gold soul sliver i need to (87:43 - 87:46)
say something bad about heart gold about (87:44 - 87:47)
still silver (87:46 - 87:51)
i mean it's a bad view so can not (87:47 - 87:54)
get a glacion you cannot get a leafeon (87:51 - 87:58)
you cannot get a magnazone you can't get (87:54 - 88:00)
anything in these games without trading (87:58 - 88:01)
two (88:00 - 88:04)
diamond and pearl correct so (88:01 - 88:08)
even though the game restricts you (88:04 - 88:10)
from getting gen 2 pokemon until you (88:08 - 88:11)
beat the game (88:10 - 88:12)
there are a few right you get like spin (88:11 - 88:14)
rack and ladybug and hair cross and (88:12 - 88:15)
stuff but like (88:14 - 88:16)
you want like a hound hour you gotta (88:15 - 88:18)
wait till the end of the game (88:16 - 88:21)
uh even the pokemon you can catch like (88:18 - 88:24)
magnemite or evie you (88:21 - 88:27)
you can't get any of the new pokemon i (88:24 - 88:28)
guess i'm just gonna beat the entire (88:27 - 88:30)
elite four with a magnet on because (88:28 - 88:32)
i mean bring back the national decks (88:30 - 88:37)
there's nowhere in the game to evolve it (88:32 - 88:37)
true very it's it's i didn't even think (88:38 - 88:43)
about it no ice block (88:40 - 88:47)
no moss stone but i will say (88:43 - 88:49)
getting rid of the icy rock in the mossy (88:47 - 88:50)
rock (88:49 - 88:53)
uh ice rock thank you not the icy rock (88:50 - 88:57)
sorry i thank you i think that was a (88:53 - 88:58)
good (88:57 - 89:02)
thing in galler yeah (88:58 - 89:05)
but i mean they got rid of look i mean (89:02 - 89:06)
not everywhere had a location right (89:05 - 89:08)
or this is the first one where the (89:06 - 89:10)
location finally no gallery is the first (89:08 - 89:12)
first place where glacion exists that (89:10 - 89:14)
did not have (89:12 - 89:16)
a location well except for the heart (89:14 - 89:17)
golden souls over (89:16 - 89:19)
so yeah this is and this is the bad this (89:17 - 89:22)
is what i'm worried about for the remake (89:19 - 89:24)
if you want to go and get a glacion a (89:22 - 89:27)
pokemon introduced in gen 4 (89:24 - 89:29)
you don't get it until like the seventh (89:27 - 89:31)
gym (89:29 - 89:35)
like you can't transfer it in from (89:31 - 89:36)
pokemon home (89:35 - 89:39)
oh okay yeah uh and (89:36 - 89:41)
it does it was the same for gen five if (89:39 - 89:43)
you wanted a glacion you had to wait (89:41 - 89:43)
till (89:43 - 89:47)
you got to the snowy mountain or (89:43 - 89:48)
whatever which i don't think you could (89:47 - 89:50)
access the whole thing until after the (89:48 - 89:51)
elite four (89:50 - 89:53)
because the rock was blocked i don't (89:51 - 89:55)
know he moved down like fridays you had (89:53 - 89:57)
to wait till like a friday yeah (89:55 - 89:59)
it was like after the sixth gym but you (89:57 - 90:00)
had to wait till friday for him to move (89:59 - 90:02)
so you can walk to it (90:00 - 90:05)
and then in gen 7 you couldn't get a (90:02 - 90:05)
glacier (90:05 - 90:08)
until literally the the cave before the (90:05 - 90:09)
elite four (90:08 - 90:13)
uh so are they are they gonna keep the (90:09 - 90:13)
gallery (90:13 - 90:17)
this is why i i get mad at remakes (90:13 - 90:19)
this is why i don't like omega ruby (90:17 - 90:20)
alpha sapphire because they went back on (90:19 - 90:21)
the hm thing (90:20 - 90:24)
where i would probably have loved uh (90:21 - 90:26)
omega it would be alpha sapphire (90:24 - 90:27)
no you would what do you mean they went (90:26 - 90:29)
back on the agent they were hms (90:27 - 90:33)
in x and y there were but not as (90:29 - 90:35)
like they really really died down the (90:33 - 90:36)
amount okay (90:35 - 90:40)
you used um (90:36 - 90:40)
and so i'm worried about the hms i'm (90:42 - 90:46)
worried that they're going to do the (90:45 - 90:47)
rock thing again (90:46 - 90:49)
which i hope they don't do the rock (90:47 - 90:51)
thing (90:49 - 90:53)
um i mean they're going to do the rock (90:51 - 90:54)
thing again yeah they're probably going (90:53 - 90:55)
to do the rock thing i mean (90:54 - 90:58)
just just dash those hopes now now i i (90:55 - 90:59)
disagree (90:58 - 91:00)
it's going to be one of the many (90:59 - 91:04)
conveniences uh that will be (91:00 - 91:07)
added in i'm not even a glaceon fan but (91:04 - 91:09)
if somebody really likes glaceon it (91:07 - 91:11)
would be nice (91:09 - 91:12)
if they could play through the game with (91:11 - 91:15)
glacion oh it's like like every other (91:12 - 91:17)
honestly and i would like to see this (91:15 - 91:19)
change for espeon umbreon and sylveon (91:17 - 91:21)
it's like every other eeveelution (91:19 - 91:24)
uses a rock let's have them all (91:21 - 91:28)
just use rocks stop with this (91:24 - 91:29)
foolishness (91:28 - 91:32)
shiny stone for espeon dust zone for (91:29 - 91:34)
umbreon (91:32 - 91:38)
or dawn stone for espeon (91:34 - 91:40)
we got a lot of rocks in this game (91:38 - 91:41)
there's a lot of rock batters they could (91:40 - 91:42)
be another (91:41 - 91:44)
rock they could be like give it an (91:42 - 91:45)
oranberry it's going to evolve into (91:44 - 91:46)
sylveon okay cool (91:45 - 91:51)
everyone whatever doesn't matter uh (91:46 - 91:55)
the rock stuff is not great (91:51 - 91:55)
true i don't know it also depends on if (91:57 - 92:01)
they change the map at all (92:00 - 92:03)
like what becomes available when like (92:01 - 92:06)
it's who knows (92:03 - 92:07)
we will see when we get there but i (92:06 - 92:09)
guarantee that most likely they are (92:07 - 92:12)
keeping the rock stuff (92:09 - 92:16)
and probably hm stuff what's also stinky (92:12 - 92:17)
is like (92:16 - 92:20)
those only (92:17 - 92:23)
only work for for the eevees (92:20 - 92:26)
they have no other purpose (92:23 - 92:29)
no uh well the magnetic field that's not (92:26 - 92:31)
does not do anything for evs i'm talking (92:29 - 92:32)
about the ice stone (92:31 - 92:35)
and the moss stone yeah um did it not (92:32 - 92:36)
work (92:35 - 92:38)
for frost last night no no no no i've (92:36 - 92:41)
done my research (92:38 - 92:43)
[Music] (92:41 - 92:46)
the inky stuff the ink stuff still makes (92:43 - 92:47)
sense (92:46 - 92:49)
like you can sell everything so far (92:47 - 92:51)
nintendo consoles have had some (92:49 - 92:56)
gyrometer gyroscope (92:51 - 92:56)
what other pokemon is a pain to evolve (92:57 - 93:02)
trade pokemon still are fine because (93:00 - 93:03)
like (93:02 - 93:05)
the traits happen is a bit of a pain (93:03 - 93:06)
because you have to remember you have to (93:05 - 93:09)
have a dark tape (93:06 - 93:12)
pancham yeah but that one like unless (93:09 - 93:14)
they've suddenly removed dark type (93:12 - 93:15)
pokemon that's fine (93:14 - 93:18)
i find the ones that you that don't do (93:15 - 93:20)
their final evolution until they're at a (93:18 - 93:22)
really high level (93:20 - 93:23)
those tend to be very frustrating (93:22 - 93:25)
because i don't use pokemon steroids (93:23 - 93:28)
so i gotta battle it out actually like (93:25 - 93:30)
full corona (93:28 - 93:32)
that's like levels 99 i know i know i (93:30 - 93:35)
know i'm aware (93:32 - 93:37)
you gotta get high dragon to like level (93:35 - 93:39)
270 before (93:37 - 93:41)
exactly two of my favorite pokemon right (93:39 - 93:44)
there that i had to suffer through (93:41 - 93:44)
yeah there there's the electric field (93:46 - 93:49)
which does what (93:47 - 93:53)
charge probopass bug and then magneson (93:49 - 93:55)
magnazone and then i'm pretty sure they (93:53 - 93:57)
just changed magnazone and (93:55 - 93:59)
probopass or sorry magnazone and (93:57 - 94:01)
chargebug to just thunderstone (93:59 - 94:04)
i'm pretty sure um (94:01 - 94:06)
i've never evolved a magnet on in sword (94:04 - 94:07)
and shield i'm assuming it's a (94:06 - 94:08)
thunderstorm i know (94:07 - 94:09)
i know charger bug is for sure (94:08 - 94:11)
thunderstone but proba pass isn't in the (94:09 - 94:13)
game at all (94:11 - 94:16)
uh but both magneton and chargebug are (94:13 - 94:18)
electric type pokemon probopass (94:16 - 94:23)
is rock steel so i'm assuming (94:18 - 94:24)
well that i would assume that it would (94:23 - 94:26)
use the thunderstone but that would (94:24 - 94:27)
probably be the only (94:26 - 94:30)
non-electric type pokemon to use a (94:27 - 94:31)
thunderstone which i don't think is a (94:30 - 94:32)
big deal (94:31 - 94:36)
uh pokemon that's four times weak to (94:32 - 94:37)
fighting type which is one of the most (94:36 - 94:38)
common used (94:37 - 94:42)
types in anyone's party that's why you (94:38 - 94:46)
bring a fairy sure so you put the (94:42 - 94:48)
you put the probopass next to sylveon (94:46 - 94:50)
and then the fighting type pokemon is (94:48 - 94:52)
scared (94:50 - 94:54)
all right (94:52 - 94:54)
then you protect and then you hyper the (94:56 - 94:59)
disarming voice or whatever (94:58 - 95:02)
would you like a pokemon for next week i (94:59 - 95:04)
would okay (95:02 - 95:06)
