[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 452nd episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host spj with me is greg hello hello hello i have nothing interesting going on how was your weekend you don't ask us about our weekend anymore you can ever ask me how my weekend went it's because when i in the history of this show when i introduce you you always have this huge like something's happening right that's will is here i have some unfortunate news that may may require me to resign from this program i have started playing call of duty what why because it's fun i've never felt so betrayed in my life i i realized that it was a spur of the moment kind of who who brought you to this doorstep what do you think that's it that relationship is over you can't have my relationship i am ending it did the call of duty involve a refer-a-friend program no oh okay that was going to be a transition until it is it is on discount so that's like a referral friend pro sure yes a friend of mine referred me to this game okay uh we have some pokemon news for today uh specifically some pokemon go news specifically there's a referral friend program coming to pokemon go so we'll talk about that um and then there's some tournament stuff coming up with the players cup three there's a korean event happening uh and that's kind of all we got for today so not a terribly busy week but hey sometimes we take those sometimes it's okay for the 25th anniversary there's a huge gap of nothing happening there should be something happening every week they should be capitalizing on 25 years pumping out the content get get it out there they're building the suspense is what they're doing a bts song out there you make us never forget this was 25 years uh sure let's let's uh start off with the pokemon go news uh this episode specifically with the invite your friends to enjoy pokemon go and earn rewards this is off pokemon go live.com this is niantic's official news website uh we are excited to announce a referral program coming soon to pokemon go i think uh if you're australian you're able to use it i saw that yes the beta testing country that is australia when you refer a friend uh to enjoy go whether it's their first time playing or returning after a break they'll receive rewards like pokemon encounters rare candy incubators and more as they hit milestones on their adventure and so will you like other features we've launched in the path past we will be turning the referral program over in time in order to make the process as exciting as possible trainers in australia will be the first to try it uh we hope you enjoy playing pogo together and then it shows a picture of uh like a new trainer with a charmander and then another trainer with a charizard it's a very cute picture so how do we feel about a referral program four and a half years into a game i mean that is generally when they're like ooh we're not getting new players now it's time to ratchet up somehow to also let's start mining like bring people back into the cult right we've had some some losses some people have have strayed from the pack and we need to get them rein them back in let's offer them some meager rewards i literally can't think of a person that i know that i could convince to play pokemon go that isn't already playing pokemon go yeah that seemed to be the general consensus was i have no one to invite playing the game uh that i that i saw but so you guys are just thinking of new people what about people who have been idle who haven't been playing for a while yeah it doesn't say that in this press release but i think the self road when they data mined this said that if the person didn't play for over 12 months or something they would be able to be referred but i was going to say you know i stream pokemon every day on twitch and it there's a shocking amount of people that just don't play go they either didn't have a phone at the time when it came out which like when go really came out if you didn't have a smartphone to play it you kind of missed out on that whole craze and then it died down of course and then you're like oh well i missed it um or they just didn't try it at all when it came out so i think i think there's i think there's still plenty of people that you can get uh i am sure there is like for example i i have no clue not that i like my brother but at one point i'm sure he liked pokemon because he i know he played the games but if i if i did like my brother and he hasn't started playing there'd be a thing of like hey you should sign up i bring up my brother because this is this is this is niantic isn't missing the mark on this lots of games enter a referral friend program many years in so it's not like they're tone deaf all the time yeah um but like uh destiny had a referral front program three years into destiny and i was able to get a handful of people to play destiny for the first time because the rewards were good and you know as somebody who was very addicted to destiny i was like oh please please i want because you got exclusive rewards as the person who referred um so i i think this is fine i'd be curious what how good the rewards become after they're done beta testing australia yeah i will say that in classic niantic pokemon go fashion their timing on this is completely off because literally i could have referred your wife and gotten a bunch of prizes because she hasn't touched pokemon go in forever except for the kanto tour which happened last month and wrecked all these people who are like i haven't touched go in years but man i can i can 151 it and get back in well now all those people are wiped out no no longer options for me my wife's an interesting go player she there's plenty of pokemon only plays when you make her that's not true i could have a built-in my husband used to play i could probably refer him there you go you're lucky i'm the only single person in this program no see irene doesn't irene will open go she'll play go she'll catch certain pokemon if it's like an oshawott a banary uh you know she's all about catching those or tapping on those but if it's like a bar boat even if she doesn't have it for the decks she's like i'm not catching that i have no like selective she has choices yeah uh speaking of making choices making choices uh dynamo mega monetric and therian form thundurus are coming in the first ever electric how is this the first ever electric type themed event okay because they haven't had an electric type themed event before that's how isn't every pikachu with a hat an electric type theme not if it doesn't include dynamo one of will anderson's favorite pokemon uh this will be from march 16th to march tuesday march 16th to monday march 22nd electro type pokemon featuring alolan geodude voltorb electric stun fisk and more appearing in the wild tynamo making its pokemon go debut the following electric type pokemon will be hatching from 5k eggs pichu ellicott electric shinx joltik dynamo and stun fisk event type research will get you to poke balls ampharos mega energy metric mega energy and encounters with more electro type pokemon timed research is available uh the following pokemon will be in raids your voltorbs your shanks blitzel clink and dynamo in one star raids alolan raichu alolan graveler magneton ampharos in three star raids and therian form thundurus will appear the first time in five star raids mega evolved monetric also known as megaminetric wow what a weird sentence they probably have to do that because mega evolves monetric all otherwise known as mega monetric got a tm r get that branding copyright will be making its pokemon debut in mega raids mega houndoom mega obama snow will also be appearing in mega raids at this time and there's a bonus your bonus is you will have a higher chance of receiving evolution items when opening gifts during this period evolution items oh is that like king snowstones unova stones dragon scales we need more stones in this game you know what this game is lacking stones i really love having 20 dragon scales to evolve just cedra am i am i am i gonna find uh tynamo in the wild or do i have to do it in raids it does say dynamo will be appearing in the wild yes okay good but let's be real you're probably gonna have to wait for it you have to wait for it that's not fair in the wild uh keep your eye out for dynamo meaning this is not going to be there keep an eye out for the raids that are going to happen in it i also only have 14 blitzel candy so this is going to be a good good time zeb striker it says striking sure i i didn't see anyone talk about this this is off uh pokemon go live as well great east japan earthquake on the 10th memorial day um [Music] uh trainers niantic's mission is to inspire people to explore the world together i do like exploring the world hopefully that will be a possibility by the end of this year together uh together i can take or leave the world over the past few years we have provided opportunities for people to visit the toh tohoku tohoku region through ingress and pokemon go hey spoiler they do do ingress events uh now in re remembrance of the great east japan earthquake 10 years ago we are recreating the rediscovery memories and local business of the tohoku program with local government and institutes of awate uh and then a bunch of other japanese cities i will try not to butcher here miyagi and fukushima prefectures this program will benefit 100 stone owner stone store owners in each pre-fixture for six months at no charge and encourage the local communities to explore their hometowns and support businesses there prefecture pre prefecture prefecture there's no i in there it wasn't you know prefecture it's probably not actually a word correct maybe not it could be no no i mean what do you call the hole you break in the wall before you put the fixture in that's a that's a pre-free fixture a pre-fixture you are now becoming like the person who will remain nameless who said to me that the star wars character's name was see what did he said c3 po and i was like you are a a crime of language on the wrong syllable his name is c3bo c three p o c p three o no go away go away go away you're even worse do not do not get me started on star wars i'm gonna call the little mermaid witch ladies c-3po is that correct greg yes yes it's c-3po i am just as star wars as greg if only two years off i was there for the premiere but it's more my brand than yours your brand is skateboarding and looking cool my brand is nerdy star wars crap looking cool it's a bit debatable uh this this uh press release is is pretty long but it is it is cool it is cool that niantic is um supporting so basically this is so march 11th what i believe is the anniversary of the big earthquake and uh was that also the tsunami yes yeah they go hand in hand um and because we we we raised money for that back in the day that was like our first charity on the podcast we ever did i think we i mean we were pretty small we raised like 100 bucks but still better than zero um but so the the intent is to get people to like visit the downtowns of the areas that were affected a decade ago is that like yeah yeah what the goal of the program is okay i will book my flight now pokemon go you have inspired me i need to get a passport oh dagnabbit yeah it's my location's still sitting there on the floor i know i have one let's make it into mexico and canada that's part of my new driver's license but i don't think this should be a minnesota thing [Laughter] we don't have that on the east coast don't don't tell them about it uh final bit of pokemon go news here is pokemon go now shows possible content of its loot box style eggs uh i think this is also did this go live for everyone i remember it was like a slow rollout i know australia got it first of course they did i haven't looked so if i look at my egg it's supposed to tell me what could be in there yeah why yeah yeah hatch eggs every day what are you talking about this is get around you tap on yeah mine's not live yet oh yeah i got nothing for for my eggs here you mean i actually have to like pay attention to what's going on in the game no no you don't have to um so when you tap on an egg it says clicking on an egg tap on an egg it will show the table of contents which differ between egg types and regularly change as the game cycles through a specific pokemon how likely you are in the position of five rarities level one that uh by having one egg symbol appears to be the most common and the five being the most rare will have so if a pokemon has five eggs that means it's the most rare no probability listed no suggestions on how much rarer one is but you at least see what could possibly be in the egg so in the example here it has one egg is a geodude and then the two eggs so these are slightly more rare than geodude would be meowth stun fisk uh sandshrew diglett me the other meowth uh grimer farfetch and then ponyta and then alolan vulpix would be more rare than that oh so what one's meowth and the other meowth one is alolan vulpix okay and then uh galleria and zigzagoon is four out of five which means it's more rare than those and then the the rarest one here i can't what is in this picture what is it oh five out of five would be the galerion dharamaka which is the ice type one we have to talk about this so i have yeah i don't have this at all in my game i have i don't have it but i do have a glare in dara maca hold on i have six eggs that are from minnesota that when i click on them don't have it i have one 7k egg that i got from a gift in new york oh it's probably when your newer eggs have it and that one has it no it can't be because i got this new york egg is older oh yeah because i haven't hatched an egg in like the last week yeah i have a march 8th 2021 from royal palm beach wow that sounds like a fancy place royal palm beach florida and it doesn't have it no but this one is from march and the other ones are from february so isn't it amazing place names i have one from from royal palm beach florida and i'm like wow what an incredibly fancy incredible place that must be and then the next one right next to it is from south elgin illinois and that just sounds like where the like the sewage treatment plant is i mean that's not a great area i have one from canada that's that has to be fancy it's probably a stantler right yeah yeah i got a bunch of but do you have anything so it must be march eggs that are showing them and not mm-hmm palm beach is from march so yeah they said march eggs march but i that it doesn't have it that's what i'm saying oh i see what you're saying but mine does weird uh niantic tweeted on march 11 saying trainers were excited to share that we're testing where a limited number of trainers will be able to see pokemon hatch in their inventory trainers will be able to test by tapping on an egg to see the list of possible pokemon and rarity please note uh this will not show if pokemon may be shiny i like how they had to include that i'm sure people were asking um yeah this is this is fine there's like this pokemon go is like the last pokemon mobile game to reveal odds because pokemon duel had odds and pokemon masters has like you can tap on it you can see leon is a one percent or um you know elisa or lisa is like a two percent so pokemon masters is very much very forward about the odds but pokemon masters is also a loot based game i do think the eggs are also loot based but you could make the argument that which i'm sure is the argument niantic makes i'm not saying it's a good argument but it is an argument where the egg is already determined once you get it you're not rolling for anything else you're just using a key which is the incubator to open it which i think is what counter strike does i think you use you buy keys to open boxes what is counter strike it's like the call of duty but for good people oh so i'm a bad people now i don't know i already said it at the time of the show it's not it's like it's november um i mean that's a real it's real week but sure i mean i don't think it holds up once the uk does something but i don't know this because the the whole reason that loot boxes need to be disclosed now is because of uk laws not u.s laws well and i'm i'm sure there's somebody out there who could make the argument that um i have to pay for incubators to hatch these eggs so you have to tell me what the chances are of getting a good one so i don't waste my paid for incubators on not good chances eggs it's like transition of fungibility of the money i'm just curious if this egg system of like the five to one is good enough for what the uk law is asking for i mean that's odds i mean it's odds yeah but we don't know how like what what does five out of five mean for daramaku we don't know if that's a one percent i'm sure that's published somewhere it's hidden in the terms and conditions that nobody reads yeah okay um last thing uh before we take a break here is the i wanted to give a tcg update the mcdonald's pikachu card it's worth five million dollars now no um so when it initially came out it was worth about eighty dollars i was watching a couple auctions before the start of stream this one ended literally 15 minutes ago uh and it the winning bid was 40 with free shipping um so it looks like it's it's dropped in price by half i don't know at this point because i haven't been to a mcdonald's in a while spoiler um i don't know if does mcdonald's still have these cards i don't know you're literally asking the wrong person yeah i don't know if um now the eyes are limited yeah i mean once they run out they run out but i'm curious if because they were restricting you must buy a happy meal to get a card well depending on your mcdonald's because every mcdonald's is different um i wonder if that kept more in stock and if now they're at a point where they just don't care anymore of like okay we don't have scalpers driving up every day so if you want some happy meals here's some happy meals i should test that i should go to mcdonald's this week and see if i can so from what i had understood from the internet and i'm very much a cursory observer of the internet i am i am not wholeheartedly invested in that particular technology um i had heard that people have moved on from happy meals to cereal boxes yes they've been tearing up in cereal boxes left and right it's like what what what a great transition will this is off pokemon.com three card pokemon tcg booster box booster packs in general mills cereal boxes go cuckoo for the pokemon tcg cards with general mills for a limited time greg do you know somebody who's over there at general mills yeah okay i'm sure i'm gonna have to check to see who's still there because you know uh if you are looking for an excuse to eat delicious cereal for breakfast lunch and dinner i i'm reading this off pokemon duck yes i am the pokemon trading card game is dishing okay there's a lot happening there's a lot happening in this uh somebody who right there the time of their life uh the pokemon trading card game is dishing up the perfect opportunity for limited time and select general middle cereals including golden grahams tricks cocoa puffs cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms will have a special three card pokemon tcg booster pack each pack will contain one foil pikachu card and two additional cards in total there are 14 unique collectible cards although the gallerian pony the i didn't know this this is the breaking news here breaking news the gallerian ponyta card will only be available in family sized cereal boxes at walmart oh a version exclusive the mouth this mouth-watering opportunity is to celebrate 25 years of pokemon while eating your favorite cereal and it's only available for a limited time i don't want to go to walmart all right nobody wants to go to walmart that's why it's exclusive there to force you to go to walmart plenty of people have a fine time at walmart let's not be minneapolis biased here look there's the real the real concern and now conspiracy that i have uncovered in researching this particular topic i have gone to the general mills website to find out what are the general mills serials especially because i wanted to find out if coco puffs because they did use the goku for blah blah blah they did say that yeah okay so they have a list of the cereals that they produce it does not include cocoa puffs it does not include reese's puffs but it does include a cereal i've never heard of called cascadian farm where are you looking general mills.com what's weird is they they released a pokemon cereal it just says pokemon in big letters it's a red box there's pikachu on it and then in very small font it's called like berry burst i think so the cereal is called berry burst or something like that berry explosion i don't know but there's no cards in that well because it's not a general meal cereal yeah but they put a cereal on shelf i bought said cereal i have not tried it yet it looks like captain crunch but with marshmallows it looks like oops all berries wait with marshmallows this is so confusing this is such a we're looking at what are we looking at i'm just i'm doing the deep research man i'm going i'm going in i'm on the dark net so i i wanted the pikachu card so and then look that article was very flavorful there was a lot of there was a lot of pokemon is a general mill series pokemon berry bolt is general very bold why why what are they doing there's no cards in the berry bolts i know there's a pikachu on the cover yeah i have an actual serious question here oh gosh uh people collect a lot of pokemon things people collect true you know everything star wars barbie beanie babies in a situation like this if i'm a pokemon collector and i bought barry bolt what like that's probably not good to leave food in cardboard for 20 some years in a plastic bag in the cardboard cardboard yeah but what if you have like they put into the new york thing what if you live in new york and you have like rats the rats will follow yes plastic only rats new york rats only live in new york correct yes milwaukee true two pikachu is a mouse on the cover rats would find the cereal eat through the cardboard baby through the plastic no they'd see the huge electric mouse and be scared away heck no i'm not like i'm not messing with that dude's berry bolts do you uh look the question i'm asking is how do we get a psa 10 pikachu box do we put it in do we send it to psa do they put it in like a uh you no you put it in a plexiglas yeah container this is not the first time people have collected cereal boxes there was a limited amount of ghostbusters cereal back in the day that people have put into class plastic containers and kept forever there's a number of limited editions so you probably you probably don't want to keep it outside of a container because because it'll go bad and it's cardboard if you get a little damp a little more although i have watched people eat 30 year old cereal on youtube that they bought don't do it don't do it but here's okay i have so many questions now number one mr surumi if i am a collector i'm not saying like i i am emphasizing that i am a collector of items the audio version of the show there's a lot of the fingers yes i why i i make an effort to preserve the items that i am collecting in the manner in which they need to be preserved so if i'm collecting cereal in boxes i'm not going to leave it someplace where it's going to get wet basic yeah okay this is another question i have here because you're just not understanding the concept of like no i am i'm just thinking of like the new day cereal the wrestler is the new day they put in a plexi glass container and keep in your freezer right now i think i think they're in a cardboard box in my basement which is probably not good like the basement is the last place for collecting things that's where the rats come in live down there you know where the chubs come in i think of the rat situation because of gosh this podcast is off the rails okay so along trust me i still have some more questions okay okay so i think of the rat situation because it was in wisconsin we get snow this might be unusual to people who don't live in the north part of the united states we get snow we got a lot of snow and uh behind me are some low income apartments you know those the people there are very nice i i know most of them that live there uh but they don't really have like an apartment manager low income it's like some dude who comes by like once a month to collect rent and to like mow the grass yeah right so during the winter uh they the guy who supposed to look after this property he like he brought his truck through to plow the alley and to plow the parking lot but he didn't shovel out the garbage cans so when the garbage men would come once a week because there was not an easy way to get to the res the garbage bins they didn't pick up the garbage and this happened for five weeks in a row of not picking up garbage and then eventually about a week and a half ago wisconsin got up to 50 degrees for like three days in a row so he didn't have to shovel because the snow melted and then you saw the glorious leftovers of what was happened and then the garbage bin eventually picked up the garbage but once it got super nice out and all the snow went away and when you pull out of the alley at 2 a.m you go oh there's a lot of rats over there oh they just came on vacation from new york they were like finally it's our time yeah i'm surprised i'm surprised they the raccoons didn't go first i think the rats at this point are bigger than the raccoons nah they work together true they sort through the things yeah okay i have put in chat the amazon.com listing for a cereal box container well i might buy this put your cereal box you need it 32 you also for i think that will pay for your children's college i want it's worth it i'm looking i'm looking at the cereal box holder sports memorabilia display case i would like a a a box a or plexiglas glass box whatever that is like perfect fit that is very satisfying you don't want to like wobble like when you're collecting like a nintendo 64 game you would want that plastic to like fit perfectly over it you don't want i mean there are multiple options listed up at the top and your curatorship of your fine collection yeah where spend the five dollars on the do not touch sign so people aren't picking things up shaking them and causing them to wobble the other dilemmas do i really care about collecting cereal are you a collector or are you in the collecting life or are you a poser well and there's also the set of people who collect pokemon items and the set of people who collect cereals and this is where they intersect but i i have to get back to this greg yes you have a sibling i do you existed in the 70s much like i did so for for the for the youth of our nation it's it's greg and will education time there have been i would say three phases of prizes is the word we will use prizes in cereal so greg in the 70s the prize used to actually be in the cereal the prize could choke you yes but it was something plastic that was in the box of cereal that was usually at the bottom of the actual back not necessarily in its own plastic yes true policy what was the policy in your home in my home the policy was the child whose bowl of cereal the prize fell into is the one who got the prize i don't know that they had an official policy that i can remember i think it was just a free-form fight we used to beat on each other and i almost always lost but usually it was something that my brother didn't want so i almost always got it there you go second phase of surprises in serial history they stopped putting the prizes in the boxes of cereal because too many people choked on them you had to send in cut off the top of the cereal box send it in five to six weeks later you'd get something in the mail this was the true end of prizes yeah that was the worst we are now to modern times because supposedly steve obtained pokemon cards in a box of cereal i bought the tricks that's all they had at target they didn't have the golden grahams they didn't have i gotta go back to this article mr cerumi and you are not according to your driver's license a child explain yourself fix are for kids how you are taking cereal from these poor children i have taken the materials from the specifically designed for only kids nutritional requirements they have golden grahams tricks cocoa puffs cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms wow i probably would have got the cinnamon toast crunch no no of cereal were they floating i haven't seen it yet i haven't opened it yet oh you're waiting for an unboxing video nice shiny or serious i think in the 90s they started putting them outside of the cereal but yeah he's still in the box outside of the cereal the plastic but in between the cardboard yeah less of a choking hat i think so is how people are ripping open boxes in the actual stores and going in and taking the cards out and still leaving a product that you could technically buy horrible horrible nobody's going to touch that box because we don't know if you injected acid into the plastic through a syringe and our design are ready to kill us all now that these shows are on youtube i think of certain words you've got to say and then i think oh we're instantly getting demonetized oh you said the words oh no i just say that because youtube has like youtube's really good at picking up words in videos like their algorithm is very good anyway anyways beep this youtube we have golden grahams tricks cocoa puffs cinnamon toast crunch lucky charms lucky charms at the bottom of the list what why no no no no no no no toast crunch is like i could have had cinnamon toast i could have made the toast to put the butter in the cinnamon it would have been delicious a little bit of sugar okay the official ruling is trix lucky charms cocoa puffs golden grahams cinnamon toast crunch what golden grass they do not taste like graham crackers they don't have golden grahams it's supposed to be like honey and graham crackers and it's not it's just bad there's not a picture here on pokemon.com but it is still slightly better than cinnamon cross toast crunch which is this is horrific is this like uh like uh early 80s things did you guys have like childhood horror of cinnamon toast crunch it tastes bad bad it tastes like cinnamon flavored cardboard trixx trixx has flavor yes yes well trixx had more flavor before they remove the sugar well everything had more flavor for them once again you can go back to what we used to do in the 70s which was like it didn't matter how much the sugar the cereal came with you put a spoonful of sugar on top of your cereal barry poppins told me to twist it in because the milk was obviously too not sugar i don't remember cocoa puffs does cocoa puffs rip up your mouth like captain crunch did no no nothing rips up your mouth like captain crunch does it captain crunch is the original mouth wrecker i would lucky charms would have been probably my number one or number two but when they removed the sugar like that the marshmallows are good like if there was a cereal of just lucky charms marshmallows i'm i'm all in i'd i had to eat it all marshmallows uh but the the oat based whatever things that they have are so flavorless and so dry nowadays that it's just if the bottom of your cereal bowl isn't a thick sludge of milk and sugar like we used to do in the 70s you are not eating your cereal correctly you would get to the bottom and you'd be like stirring the sludge because you got milk sugar to eat yeah i mean i would do that for like cheerios because you needed sugar yeah you're cheerios yeah absolutely and you still do you still do no but the but the marshmallows make up for the fact that the the other part of lucky charms is forgettable that is just there for texture yeah but other parts there i have the marshmallows with it so then you think well i'm taking the best part of lucky charms like the bolt berry i haven't had it yet but it has the lucky charms marshmallows wait were you the kind of person that would pick out all the marshmallows and leave the actual nutrition in the bowl of lucky charms oh yeah yeah hello when i was like eight years old you busted out two bowls and then you poured the cereal in one and then you moved the marshmallows to the other bowl and then when you were done you poured back the nutrition into the box oh you that's why all of your brothers and sisters hate you i i was doing them a favor by giving them nutrition i have one more mystery here which this has now sent me down the path of i cannot determine from the internet whether cookie crisp is still made or not uh i think it's still made cause that was a good cereal literally eat cinnamon toast crunch over cookie crisp let me tell you the best cereal i mean cookie crisp is still made by general mills this is the best supposedly but if they don't have a website for it we'll have to permanently i'm looking at it right now the best cereal is count chocula what i don't like chocolate oh my gosh no blueberries the best blueberry is pretty good too yeah but you can only get that at certain times of the year nothing that's because it's that good nothing top fruit fruit fruit brute was the best i gotta go to walmart discontinued how much is this pony ponyta card on ebay i don't want to go to walmart plus you need four of them because i'm running a ponyta yeah so like you okay so here's the thing it's like you can't buy cookie crisp in a store you can only order it online it's like a boutique cereal now they have to like special make for you when you order it that sounds nice sounds fancy i miss yummy mummy too fruit fruit and yummy mummy were so good do you think if the cereal was sitting on your front porch in a box the rats would get it yes no so how long is it out there rats and mice don't like things that are new it needs to have been there for a while so that they assume that nobody's going to touch it because they're very polite that's right and they're like no well it's polite it's like i will i will let everyone else have an opportunity to enjoy this oh nobody else is going to have it are you sure this is how i unfortunately learned that one of my pokemon packages from one of the pokemon events apparently had a cookie in it that i had forgotten about for roughly 10 years because i found i found the package and the mice were having a grand old time eating that pokemon cookie oh that's my biggest fierce mice or rats in the house your biggest i mean you have my house right now maybe everybody does whether or not they come into your home is to search for food i mean you have three cats so so maybe not you may never see them i have two dogs who love to hunt mice uh and they're very bad at it well speaking of being bad uh let's take a break nice and when we come back we will talk a little bit more about pokemon news what is a nidoran supposed to be it's a mix of a porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs mouse whales jackalope probably a horse and hamster porcupine a rabbit dinosaur is a mountain whales jackalopes probably a horse yeah but then like what [Music] a rabbit dinosaurs a mouse whale jackalope probably a horse and hamster and we are back uh we don't have a lot of news here uh but the first bit of news we have is korean news um we actually don't know a lot about it but there was uh so um there was an event in japan called the phantom challenge and the phantom challenge allowed you to get a genesect a volcanion and a mar shadow and pokemon sword and shield uh and it was the way you would get that is by going to like 711 in japan and buying stuff or going to the pokemon center and buying stuff i think there were some other stores that participated but like if you bought a pack of cards you would get like four points and if you bought like tea like a t packet at 7 11 you would get one point and i think the t was like 80 yen so that was like the cheapest way to get one point uh and then you would go to this website on pokemon.co.jp and you would redeem the points and then the points would give you genesect volcania and mars shadow there was a master ball it would give you safari ball sports ball other apricorn balls dynite or armorite ore i made a whole youtube video about it on how you can make an account redeem the points i also suggested a couple ebay sellers you could go to because of course if you didn't have a friend in japan that was sending you codes there was some stuff you could import to get the codes as well like you could import shiny star v and shiny star v packs would have the codes so you could get both cards and codes anyways that video is on youtube the phantom challenge in japan goes until april 30th so you still have time if you want to get those pokemon but the phantom challenge is coming to korea now they said coming soon so there's not an actual start date but it is the same genesect volcanion mar shadow i don't know if this phantom challenge event will come to the united states if it does it would probably not be go to 7-eleven and buy something for points we've never really had that sort of system uh but i think at least the marshado and the the volcanion are pretty sought after pokemon genesect not so much because genocide was in pokemon go for a very long time it came back quite frequently you can catch as many genesect as you want for a low low price of one dollar a raid pass and then you could transfer those into your pokemon home but volcanion on marsh shadow not so much but whenever i would expect maybe this coming week or next week they'll reveal more more details for the korean event also i just didn't know that pokemon korea.com.kr is just a whole website they got their own pokemon center they got like why wouldn't it be yeah yeah i guess you know i just don't really think of think of it they they're up to date with pokemon news they got the tcg pokemon go cross news on their website they got the rude movie they're they're doing their own thing do they have a release date for this rude movie in korea no they don't i thought i know well i mean also i'm not very good at reading korean [Music] i tried to learn they just on the website it just says 2021 so that's this year that would be this year still don't know when we're getting the zeroed movie technically they have about nine and a half months left some other news off pokemon center is that uh they released a gosh it's already sold out [Laughter] 250 charizard figure it's charizard rising flames figure by first four figures it was a pre-order uh it is a very big statue it looks like you need two hands to hold it and it i believe so it's coming in november you pre-ordered it on the website it's 12 inches tall has an eight and a half inch base it will light up by uh and be powered by usb and there's a little button to light it up it's made by the company who makes it is first four figures i don't know what else they make never heard of them before but this was not the i mean like what was how what was that skylab statue was like what 130 and it didn't sell out that quick i don't think it sold out because skyla is not charizard yeah i mean that's really where the conversation was leaning i mean as much as as much as there are vocal people that dislike charizard there are way too many people that love charizard that just they don't care wow this statue is not good no and you know what's funny is like i'm sure it's sold out with a bunch of people who are going to put it on ebay and they don't understand the rule of like real collectibles that people go wild for are usually the ones that are easily portable not something that weighs 10 pounds and you'd have to hold the two hands uh yeah i guess like the skateboards did pretty well resell wise once again very lightweight easy to carry around you think you don't have to carry it you can ride it around you're a shredder i'm trying to see if there's any uh i found the end figure the end figure was sold out i'm pretty sure that was one pretty sure that was 130 when it was up here's the skyla one scala out of stock but it was in stock for quite a while they don't have any other big statues here we can compare this charizard too they have this uh nendroid the nendroid trainer red champion version 100 here's the real question on the nendroid stuff do i buy this celebration reversible jacket no it's really bad no if there's anything from the celebration stuff that's like decent it's that power a case for 20 bucks it's under new releases it's like right next to the charizard that jacket is awful are you kidding me greg it's that jacket that would go like oh i love those yeah that's called a windbreaker sir yeah yeah you don't want that i mean here's the thing i say this knowing that you can wear windbreakers for exactly one week out of the year in minnesota it is an event-only situation now this this is way too flashy yeah you you would you would literally wear it on like the the i would wear it on community days you know i would you would also only ever wear it where it's like the black side with the little pikachu two five on the breastplate no you would never wear the silver and black with the huge pikachu clearly don't you clearly don't know how i wear things yeah you gotta i say you i mean me yeah i would wear the shiny awful song you got to get the pokemon celebration gray fitted tank top so you can show your guns ooh i do like tank tops my guns have been suffering lately my guns are terrible right now oh i don't like the thing in the front though it's the pikachu phase yeah it's too big it's too big i mean i like this model though it's too big too big of a design honestly yeah i couldn't wear that at the gym it's gonna that's gonna it's got it's gonna there are too many questions that are coming out of that the smaller one you know people can look at it and just sort of nod while they're flexing in the mirror and you can nod back okay here's this here's the next question do we buy the pokemon celebration express electric model train it's not oh in l train though no i mean lionel trains are normally 300 400 yeah because they are quality no i feel like i need i feel like in order to own a train like that i need a living room so big or uh you know when you walk into somebody's house and they just have a bunch of empty space because it's like the foyer and then they have like this grand staircase going up and then you can just like my house yeah there's fancy rooms and stuff like i need a space like that no what you need is a house with a mostly finished basement and you take one of those rooms and that is your pokemon collectible room you have the terrain in the center you have your cereal boxes on one walls you have your plushies on the others and when you bring somebody down and you have the door shut you say are you ready to see something special and then you throw open the door and they faint uh from excitement yes that is from excitement i think maybe train collectors are worse than pokemon collectors they gotta pay like 150 for like a little model tree to sit next to their train i mean it depends on how you define worse than yeah but i think it's a way more expensive hobby oh it's a way more expensive hobby for like hands down like people who collect model trains they're they're entire models of their home towns piece by piece they are taking pictures of you at night so they can model your likeness in the city they are they are the most committed of all collectors and that doesn't come cheap yeah that's probably true um did you buy the appleton plush yet no it sold out instantly unless it's back in stock it's out of stock oh you got me excited for me i was like i'll buy it right now on there we got we got a little time this week to do uh to do a couple questions of the week so we're gonna jump over to our attic channel from our slack community from patreon addict from the slack slack from the patreon uh this is from brian oh sorry greg great question of the week greg i mean we could just go into it it's fine no no no no it's not fine all right i want the question of the week yeah was that like jazz yeah tiny little jazzy uh what pokemon related fad have you not been able to understand no matter how hard you try how are we defining fads like i like the whole pokemon thing overall is a fad i don't i still don't get why people are doing this breakbox thing like you've explained it a lot of times and i still think it sounds like a paramedic it is a pyramid scheme i don't get it and i think that's a fad um true so i'm gonna pick that one so that you two can't use it speaking of the we greg and i were talking about this yes uh because i wanted to do this year i want to do a couple charity events uh we we had a lot of success with the two charity events we did last year we did the color for change change for color color for change and then we ran uh we so we raised um money for that then we raised money for starlight and so i was i i think breakboxes are cool in the concept of how i explained it in my youtube video of like me and will decided to go on our break box instead of going to target and buying packs we can save money if we go into a break box very cool and people do like opening pokemon cards so i was thinking for some charity events in the future we could do a break box but instead of you buying into a pack you're just donating to charity and if you donate to charity i will open a pack in your name and then i will send you the cards and when it's done you're you're buying the pack no i'm not getting into the money it's going right here yes where the money's destination does not change the that's true yeah the money i receive cards from that pack that i sent you money for uh also reminder that we are one year out from the 10-year anniversary of your original pokemon art show it hasn't been 10 years that was 2012 dude oh next year will be 10 years yeah that's what i said we're one year out from 10 years it was time to start planning now so it's not because we're not making those last minute phone calls to me can you call the guy who manages this building because he won't give me the key to get in and i'm like all right put on will anderson business voice i wouldn't want people to donate to charity just to get one booster pack though i would want people to donate to charity because they're donating to charity well yes that's that's how it works i mean but they're donating to charity people donate to charity to get all sorts of things anyways that's like a tried and true fundraising thing yeah oh yeah yeah yeah you know i wouldn't want people to be like 20 for a pack of cards you're ripping people off it's like no no no no no no you're you're once again it's it's it's the pokemon go thing it's it applies in all different areas they're they're donating to cherries so charities that they can be part of the experience of you opening the break box yeah but you could argue that you're giving a youtuber 500 to be part of an experience i could argue a lot of things buddy you could argue that but i mean so i think that it's different so there's something different when the person's like i'm just buying it for myself and you can be a part of this there's then i'm running something for charity and as part of this charity event we're doing something unusual that is a very different not selfish sort of i'm making you pay for my content to get a good break like it's like somebody who would shave their head for like five thousand dollars of charity yeah like it costs nothing to shake your head right certainly well aware of that i mean i'm not i will never do that i don't know don't quote me on that uh no but i think like you could charge a premium price because it is for charity like people view rightly so events for charity and associated prices a lot different than this is go this is going straight into my wallet like those aren't equal things on the scale so i mean people like there are auctions where it's like you know here's an edible arrangements retail cost is 50 and people will bid on it and it'll hit 200 because they're really using that as an entryway to get into giving to the charity like it a lot of ways makes it easier for a lot of people to say i can spend a lot of money because i'm still getting a little something out of it but that that sort of helps me overcome some resistances i might have about just i'm just gonna give these people a thousand dollars and feel good about myself like it is just an extra way to get people into the charity because they feel like they're getting a little bit of something out of it yeah yeah yeah whereas a youtuber's breakbox they're like i'll say your name on who cares like i'm paying you a thousand dollars to say my name no thank you and have somebody very famous do it for a lot cheaper you know the fad i don't really understand no i do understand it though but i also don't what is it i like there are fan made pokemon games that are super difficult oh yeah yeah and i have just never seen pokemon as like a hard game and i i say that because i i do understand pokemon i've done a lot of raids dynamaxx adventures with people that sometimes don't understand pokemon as well near storm drain we are not going down this pathway with you um okay i just like if i'm looking for a hard game why would i want to my thought process is if i'm looking for a hard game why would i want to play a fan made game that is doesn't that is that is hard when there are just hard games out there that exist there are varying quality of fan made games and i have played a couple i played the ones that i tend to play are where they have actually altered the pokemon type a little bit so that they are like everybody sort of felt like lex ray should be electric dark so i played a game where they made a luxury electric dark and change the moves so i wasn't there to play for the difficulty because the difficulty is negligible like you can overlevel everything i usually i usually have played those because they have done something they have created their own unique spin on the actual pokemon themselves and have altered the game that way and i would like to experience that um the the difficulty thing is whatever like pokemon's never ever no no turn-based leveling game is ever going to be difficult if you can over level well i i would tell there's actually a flaw in steve's thinking a fundamental flaw for the last 32 years in this particular topic and it's it's it's around you're like why if i'm looking for a difficult game why would i play pokemon that's that's not that's not where this is coming from i will tell you the brief story my the first guy that i ever dated his favorite band was you too to the point that he would literally still actually to this day only listen to you two he has every single youtube album he's a member of their fan club he goes and whenever they're on tour he follows them around the world will not listen to another band there are pokemon fans out there who the only game that they ever want to play is pokemon they don't want to find another game that could possibly be more difficult they only want to play pokemon and if i can get pokemon difficult flavor all the better because i'm just gonna play pokemon so give it to me in a version that's more challenging for me yeah i it's like if i wa if the difficulty is i want to lose and suffer over and over i can just yeah i can just go on ranked ladder and i can lose this it's in the game i mean there is a different thing there there is in certain fan games you know i've watched i have watched many a youtuber do let's play in randomizers there is something about a game that you know very very well and i watch a friend of the show vince i watch vince do randomizers uh for vince's favorite game and there's something exciting about not knowing what's going to happen in a game that you know very very well uh so there is something exciting about randomizers or a person that has changed the nature aspects of the parts of the game because there is a sense of i'm going to get a bunch of surprises out of a thing that i already know really well and love and there's a lot of excitement there it's it's it's also why i like a lot of remakes because sometimes they will sneak things in there that are like oh they changed this or they did this a little bit different and those sort of surprises are very exciting to me as well i think there's a lot of that in in those fan made games that are very appealing there's just i i i do see an appeal to i can't remember that game that vince plays um but i've seen like majora's mask randomizers uh where they're built in a way where you can still beat it but you know you get you might do dungeons in a different order you might get things in a different order and if you really like that game i guess i see that appeal but for me there's just so many video games out there and i'm sure people listening to the show they probably have like 40 games in their steam list that they bought on sale that they never played that no i just keep buying the game like if i if i had unlimited free time i feel like i would just want to play other games and get that like this is the first time in in a really long time where i have sat down and played a different jrpg i bought bravely default 2 and i've been playing through it and the last rpg i played was persona 5 which was gosh what was that three years ago now um so it's very rare that i've i've played a different rpg that isn't pokemon and i play a lot of pokemon obviously play it every day on stream but when when i play those games i just think of how dramatically different they are for pokemon and i see that more as a plus than going like oh i just changed lux rated dark type isn't this game zany now it's like no not really yeah but i mean this is the same phenomenon i have at least seven streaming services that i pay for and what am i watching again i've restarted legend of korra because there is something even though i could watch anything else i know for a fact that i like this thing i don't know that i'm investing time and effort money into something that i don't like and that's always sort of the risk of going with something new new is sometimes you don't want new new sometimes you want comfort and have it changed a little bit sometimes you want sometimes you want the special edition of star wars instead of the original version of star wars sometimes what no nobody ever wants that stop with your controversial opinions sometimes you want the prequels and not the original trilogy there i mean they exist in the same time and i don't think it's a i don't think it's a fair criticism just to say oh just play a different game if you want harder because the impulse to play something that is very comforting and something you know well but have it have it seem like a fresh new experience is something we do in a lot of other multimedia and we don't rag on people for like oh you've watched parkins parks and recs for the 15th time in a row we don't look at them and say why don't you watch the office i think there are but they're jerks i mean i do that to my twitch chat all the time they're like hey steve why don't you watch all these animes why i've only seen like three enemies why would i watch anything is it gonna be better than full metal alchemist brotherhood yes probably uh no some of them are better than the full metal alchemist brotherhood does set a high bar but it is very good the highest of bars it's a pretty high bar in this house but i mean so if they released yet another full metal alchemist that was a that was 90 the same story because they did this yes that is like releasing a fan game of pokemon you would be tempted to watch the third version of full metal alchemist because you really liked it and you're curious about what they changed i guess i'm in a position where i'm not ever bored with pokemon like i like like we we literally have a to-do list list i'm never bored with pokemon either but sometimes i'm like i i'm making room on my list to have this experience to see if i like it yeah yeah i just like i have my ribbon quest i have a nuzlocke i am trying to complete the the pokedex in in black two white two oh good luck with that open shiny years you've been trying to complete that gosh it's been like two years like i have so many things to do in pokemon that i can't fathom trying to trying to do a fan made game and a part of that and i'm well aware part of that is like that's not why i come to pokemon right like i i can't i feel good playing through fire red leaf green because i can move this pokemon up um i mean one of your main reasons is for collecting yes like for me one of my main reasons is for story so if i can get a story set in a region that i like that feels new or has been changed that is a draw to me and if i wanted if i wanted it to be harder i could set those rules on myself and people do that's why nuzlockes exist yeah and i've gotten better at the game just because of learning how to competitive battle and i can't take that knowledge of i have a dialga that is now electric fairy because that just throws it all off that doesn't like teach me anything i mean it does i mean yeah if i was there i know how to make a chocolate cake so therefore learning how to make a lemon chiffon three layer cake will teach me nothing i already know cake i do like lemon cake i love lemon cake it's my favorite uh i mean you're not i mean you're in it for very different reasons uh and that's valid like a fan-made game for how you enjoy consuming pokemon means nothing to you yeah yeah yeah like you are not you are never going to be a person that is in to playing pokemon for the reasons why people turn to fan made games yeah and i i could play pokemon every day i mean i have i have played every day um and i am i'm still not bored with it so i i'm i'm i would assume that the people that turn to fan made games are bored with the general in and out and or they're just what you said which i didn't think about they don't want to try anything new right i mean i have turned to fan main games and i will hardly say that i'm bored with pokemon but sometimes i've gone to them being like i want to revisit this and i want it to feel a little bit different and i don't want to erase my current game so yeah that's my thing it's like i never want to erase a pokemon cartridge that i've played through because that's my story yeah yeah i'm the same way with that one i have been known to buy three and four copies of game and i'm like i want to play it again like the fact that i can create new profiles on the switch to start the game over again has been a life changer you do you know x and y is up to 50 bucks now used really yeah that game's not good well how much how much is heart gold soul silver with the pokewalker with pokewalker is a hundred probably 120. how much is uh box going for right now i mean see if i can tell probably 800. oh boy you want to sell your pokemon box to me greg no never okay never mind you can borrow it this is from casey with uh understanding that people enjoy playing differently i look i didn't mean to line up these two questions yeah you did uh why do people put so much weight in things like smogon uh this is an unofficial fan generated thing but some people look at it as actual competitive pokemon when it's clearly not boy oh boy it's a good question [Laughter] here's the thing that i cannot knock smoke on for is they are a group of people that have dissected the math they have gone through trolled like they do know what they are talking about when they are talking about how pokemon works how the moves work like if nothing else their level of knowledge is very high and when you have a high knowledge about something people do look at you like an expert on that thing so you may not like what smogon does for rule sets they focus on a very unique aspect of the game they have focused on what they think better balances the game and makes the game more fun based off of how their users play it but there is still a benefit from going to a group of people who are very very knowledgeable in certain aspects of the game and learning from them so by that fact alone smogon carries weight because they have a history of being able to do really in-depth analysis and tell you [Music] explain show you the math of how they got there that is that is has an important place and you can choose to follow them or not but they are experts i would say my way of saying pretty much the same thing that greg said with a slightly different spin is the the goal of smogon and the smoke on tears is to create a competitive pokemon environment where there is a management of the metagame so that there actually is balance in the way that the game is played so you don't end up like in standard vgc where the top 10 teams were pretty much all the same pokemon same stats same everything maybe i used to have this feeling but i disagree okay but no no so so i would say that is the intent of smogon the problem that comes out of it are the number of people who then take that to mean that smogon tears are real pokemon battling because i have literally been at pokemon like a competitive vgc events where i have had teams and somebody said well that's not allowed and i said if it wasn't allowed then the rules that we downloaded onto my 3ds would have stopped me from doing this you just don't understand that smogon is not vgc right and vgc is its own environment yeah like smogon has like sand attack band and like double team band yeah and also i will say probably smogon had more validity years ago when tpci was not doing like seasons of vgc and altering what's and actually having banned lists it's like they would update the vgc once a year at most versus once a month like they do now yeah i when i when i saw this quest i'm gonna go back to the first question what fan what pokemon fad do you not understand how hard you try i don't understand people who do competitive single battles it's like just do double like doubles is significantly better oh no no rotation is significant forever so like smoke on to me is like the competitive smash scene they hate fun they they take everything they take everything out cause is very they they don't like the randomization either like they don't like um like like santa tech and double team is like the obvious thing they they ban sand attack and they ban double team these are both moves that have counters to use aerial ace air release never misses there's plenty of moves that get around double team and sand attack taunt is another one use taunt um but because singles is just bad it doesn't work as well as it would in a doubles format would um also dynamax like if somebody sand attacked you six times you can just dynomax and you don't miss uh but like it's weird in the sense of i think of other nintendo published games like mario kart i don't there is probably competitive mario kart out there with items off completely i just can't ever imagine doing that so when i wouldn't you just play a racing game well well that's that's what i think when i watch competitive smash and i know there are people that super super love competitive smash but why why like smash is has items dropping and there's things on the map and and people can probably and i'm sure people have gotten really good with the items that exist and with the the maps that change and stuff but like if you don't want any items or any randomizations why aren't you just playing a different fight yeah this is actually the perfect segue for me to announce my um entry into the world of professional mortal kombat okay all right so i'm gonna become a pro more mortal combat player well but with gosh i was watching a streamer the other day and they were doing a um they were doing smogon standard singles and there was a toxic croak that got sent out so the player's best option was to send in a puka muku because the toxic croak already sword stanced this was a single battle and so the player blocked the toxic crook from switching and then the toxic croak drain punched and then the pukamiku recovered and the toxic drain punched the pukamuku recovered and i'm not exaggerating oh how exciting they were on turn 54. of their battle before one of the because the puka muku couldn't switch out because the toxic croak did four three swords dances which is max max's physical attack and the toxic crow couldn't switch because it was blocked and the puka muku couldn't do any damage because uh it because toxic kirk's dry skin ability didn't let pukimi could do any damage so it was literally drain punch recover drain punch recover until both pokemon ran out of pp and the the the streamer still lost but it was like a hundred turn game why real 6d chess right there why would anyone want to do that why would you want to spend 50 plus minutes in a pokemon match and every singles match is the same we're going to set up toxic we're going to set up some spikes we're going to stop some stealth rocks we're going to protect we're going to protect we're going to hope that they switch here we're going to swords dance okay we're going to sweep now like nah my cloister is going to rapid spin i mean there are it's it's so painful to not only play but to watch is awesome for you for people that really really like that like there are people there are people who like to watch who like to watch ad play golf people like to watch and play golf one of the slowest games out there you can watch bowling well yeah you can watch bowling yes there are people that enjoy that style of play there are people who see a different level of skill in that type of play than in doubles like doubles has more practical real world used if you want to go into the vc vgc scene but there is something amongst a group of people or like we're doing singles and we're going to come up with this and they can be marathon matches they can be quick matches like it is a different skill set that they value you don't have to value it oh i don't they do and we know you don't like when i when i'm going i'm going through a heart gold soul silver nuzlocke and uh murdering pokemon none of the gym leaders have been hard and the things that worry me the most and the things that i have almost lost my entire team to is any trainer in a double battle because they just have so many more options um and they they have so much more coverage that um like for example bugsy was super easy i just i just used harden like four times in a row and a geodude and then i just rock through it after i was done setting up like bugsy couldn't touch me whitney was also super easy literally same strategy just harden like twice okay if miltank stomps or rolls out it does like one to two damage and then i just rock throw it like every gym leader so far in this nuzlocke has been a complete pushover and there was one trainer in harcole soul silver in particular all like i was over leveled i was 32 when i got to him both his pokemon were 25 he had an electabuzz and he had a magmar and between those two pokemon he could one shot anything if if i did a bad switch or if i didn't like target or prioritize and if he would have knocked out one or two pokemon he would have knocked out my whole team like i just think double battles are significantly more interesting and significantly more challenging than than the single format offers but i get why pokemon does single format because it is very easy on a player to understand this is a fire pokemon i have a grass pokemon i will switch to a water pokemon it is a lot harder to comprehend they have a fire and an electric if i switch out a water pokemon i can do the fire but the electric can get me if i switch in a uh grass pokemon well that's just a bad switching and all together you need ground yeah you need to rock around but triple battles though yeah that's what the real magic is that's the that's the real will what is our pokemon of the week uh well last week's pokemon of the week we were doing easy um so i listed off that uh it's part of a family that includes a whole bunch of different types but not all of the types and it required uh you to be in a specific location for evolution um and then also mentioned that in one episode of the cartoon cynthia used one to freeze some river water because melowetta was sick and she needed a little ice pack it needed an ice pack and then oshawott fell in love with mellowetta that's a great episode um and uh the only place that you've ever been able to find one of these in the wild to catch it was in galler and also they have switched and somebody debated with me over whether you use a held item but i believe that's the official term for items that pokemon can hold even if they can also just be applied to evolve that pokemon although maybe evolution item i don't know either way you can have a pokemon hold this particular item you don't have to use it to evolve them so that's why i consider it a held item but either way you no longer need to be in a specific location you just apply this item and the pokemon evolves it's chat chat does not evolve or yes no not with that attitude it's not an april remix that's evolving into dynamaxx mega chat wow gigantic mac chat scream scream stat it's glacion easy mode it was glacion you are correct uh i officially hate shuffle i hate it shuffle like huh oh uh do you know look i've made it through the whole episode without saying anything bad about heart gold soul sliver i need to say something bad about heart gold about still silver i mean it's a bad view so can not get a glacion you cannot get a leafeon you cannot get a magnazone you can't get anything in these games without trading two diamond and pearl correct so even though the game restricts you from getting gen 2 pokemon until you beat the game there are a few right you get like spin rack and ladybug and hair cross and stuff but like you want like a hound hour you gotta wait till the end of the game uh even the pokemon you can catch like magnemite or evie you you can't get any of the new pokemon i guess i'm just gonna beat the entire elite four with a magnet on because i mean bring back the national decks there's nowhere in the game to evolve it true very it's it's i didn't even think about it no ice block no moss stone but i will say getting rid of the icy rock in the mossy rock uh ice rock thank you not the icy rock sorry i thank you i think that was a good thing in galler yeah but i mean they got rid of look i mean not everywhere had a location right or this is the first one where the location finally no gallery is the first first place where glacion exists that did not have a location well except for the heart golden souls over so yeah this is and this is the bad this is what i'm worried about for the remake if you want to go and get a glacion a pokemon introduced in gen 4 you don't get it until like the seventh gym like you can't transfer it in from pokemon home oh okay yeah uh and it does it was the same for gen five if you wanted a glacion you had to wait till you got to the snowy mountain or whatever which i don't think you could access the whole thing until after the elite four because the rock was blocked i don't know he moved down like fridays you had to wait till like a friday yeah it was like after the sixth gym but you had to wait till friday for him to move so you can walk to it and then in gen 7 you couldn't get a glacier until literally the the cave before the elite four uh so are they are they gonna keep the gallery this is why i i get mad at remakes this is why i don't like omega ruby alpha sapphire because they went back on the hm thing where i would probably have loved uh omega it would be alpha sapphire no you would what do you mean they went back on the agent they were hms in x and y there were but not as like they really really died down the amount okay you used um and so i'm worried about the hms i'm worried that they're going to do the rock thing again which i hope they don't do the rock thing um i mean they're going to do the rock thing again yeah they're probably going to do the rock thing i mean just just dash those hopes now now i i disagree it's going to be one of the many conveniences uh that will be added in i'm not even a glaceon fan but if somebody really likes glaceon it would be nice if they could play through the game with glacion oh it's like like every other honestly and i would like to see this change for espeon umbreon and sylveon it's like every other eeveelution uses a rock let's have them all just use rocks stop with this foolishness shiny stone for espeon dust zone for umbreon or dawn stone for espeon we got a lot of rocks in this game there's a lot of rock batters they could be another rock they could be like give it an oranberry it's going to evolve into sylveon okay cool everyone whatever doesn't matter uh the rock stuff is not great true i don't know it also depends on if they change the map at all like what becomes available when like it's who knows we will see when we get there but i guarantee that most likely they are keeping the rock stuff and probably hm stuff what's also stinky is like those only only work for for the eevees they have no other purpose no uh well the magnetic field that's not does not do anything for evs i'm talking about the ice stone and the moss stone yeah um did it not work for frost last night no no no no i've done my research [Music] the inky stuff the ink stuff still makes sense like you can sell everything so far nintendo consoles have had some gyrometer gyroscope what other pokemon is a pain to evolve trade pokemon still are fine because like the traits happen is a bit of a pain because you have to remember you have to have a dark tape pancham yeah but that one like unless they've suddenly removed dark type pokemon that's fine i find the ones that you that don't do their final evolution until they're at a really high level those tend to be very frustrating because i don't use pokemon steroids so i gotta battle it out actually like full corona that's like levels 99 i know i know i know i'm aware you gotta get high dragon to like level 270 before exactly two of my favorite pokemon right there that i had to suffer through yeah there there's the electric field which does what charge probopass bug and then magneson magnazone and then i'm pretty sure they just changed magnazone and probopass or sorry magnazone and chargebug to just thunderstone i'm pretty sure um i've never evolved a magnet on in sword and shield i'm assuming it's a thunderstorm i know i know charger bug is for sure thunderstone but proba pass isn't in the game at all uh but both magneton and chargebug are electric type pokemon probopass is rock steel so i'm assuming well that i would assume that it would use the thunderstone but that would probably be the only non-electric type pokemon to use a thunderstone which i don't think is a big deal uh pokemon that's four times weak to fighting type which is one of the most common used types in anyone's party that's why you bring a fairy sure so you put the you put the probopass next to sylveon and then the fighting type pokemon is scared all right then you protect and then you hyper the disarming voice or whatever would you like a pokemon for next week i would okay some pokemon live in a universe all their own some pokemon require you to have caught other pokemon before they will agree to meet you some pokemon had to be obtained through the dream radar some pokemon could be encountered in the skies above hoenn some pokemon could be encountered in the ultra space wilds some pokemon can now be encountered on a dynamax adventure some pokemon are sometimes immune to normal fighting and ground sometimes they are not some pokemon make use of a mostly light colored modeled with black and brown globular item that might be given to you apocryphally by the striat and city gym leaders alternate forms to swap their attack and defense-based stats [Laughter] what just happened you want me to read that last sentence again no you need a poem ends with an ot yes chat that yes no they gotta
